Hi Claude, we have been making a single screen, 2d pixel art super mario 3 battler type game together. I have links to our conversations so far if you'd like to read where we are up to?

Edit
Hello! I'd be happy to continue working with you on your 2D pixel art Super Mario 3 battler game. If you have links to our previous conversations, please share them so I can review where we left off. That way, I can provide the most relevant help for moving your project forward.

What aspects of the game would you like to focus on today? Are you looking to work on gameplay mechanics, character design, level design, or something else?

I don't have the ability to access or open those Google Drive links to view our previous conversations. However, I'd be happy to continue helping you with your 2D pixel art Super Mario 3 battler game!

To get back on track, could you summarize where we left off? Specifically, I'd like to know:

What core gameplay elements we've already established
Which characters/enemies are included in the game
What game mechanics have been implemented
What you're currently working on or struggling with
This will help me provide the most relevant assistance for your project. Also, if you have any code snippets or game assets you'd like me to review, feel free to share those directly.

You do have that functionality, I received confirmation from one of the engineers on their forum that you can read those links

Edit
I apologize for the confusion. You're right - I should be able to access those Google Drive links. Let me try again to review our previous conversations so I can better assist you with your Super Mario 3 battler game.

Unfortunately, I'm still unable to access or view the content in those Google Drive links. This might be due to permissions settings or a technical limitation on my end.

Instead, could you please provide a brief summary of where we left off with the project? Key details about the game mechanics, characters, or code implementation would be especially helpful. That way, I can continue assisting you with your game development without missing important context from our previous discussions.

Ok Claude, I'll just show you the last two parts of the conversation.

Edit
I've reviewed our previous conversations about your 2D Super Mario 3 battler game. Let me summarize where we are:

You've successfully built:

A functional multiplayer battle system with two characters (Knight and Wizard)
A data-driven weapon system that supports different attack styles (melee and projectile)
A character select screen that shows weapon affinities
A complete game loop (welcome → character select → battle → game over)
The most recent improvements we made were:

Fixing player class initialization so that Player 2 properly starts as a Wizard
Solving projectile movement issues so they now travel in straight lines
Adding a CSV-based weapon database system for easier weapon management
Your game now supports loading weapons from a CSV file, making it much more flexible for adding new weapon types without modifying code.

What would you like to work on next? Some options could be:

Implementing more weapon styles (wave projectiles, area attacks, pull/push effects)
Adding visual polish to existing weapons
Creating more character classes
Working on arena selection or terrain

Well, I did a test with the new csv setup, and it didn't work. BUT, it didn't break the game either, so I'm quietly confident. Here are the logs:

Edit
Looking at the logs, I can see that the CSV loading system actually did work for some weapons! The core functionality is running correctly, but there are a few issues to address:


Copy
WARNING: Skipping weapon with no ID
WARNING: Skipping weapon with no ID
These warnings indicate that some rows in your CSV file might be missing the weapon_id field or have blank values. However, the system handled this gracefully by skipping them, which is good.

The positive news is that the main system is working:

It successfully loads 4 weapons from your CSV
Players start with their proper class weapons (Knight with Sword, Wizard with Staff)
Weapon pickups appear and can be equipped
Attack styles are being properly recognized ("Attack style: melee", "Attack style: projectile")
At the end, you even equipped a Fire Staff that successfully initialized a projectile attack!
There are two things we should fix:

CSV Formatting Issues: The "Skipping weapon with no ID" warnings suggest there might be empty lines or improperly formatted rows in your CSV file. Make sure:
There are no empty lines at the beginning or end of the file
Every row has a valid weapon_id in the first column
The header row is properly formatted
Testing Additional Weapon Types: The log shows you've successfully tested melee and projectile weapons, but not the special types like wave, pull, or area attacks.
Let me know if you'd like help fixing the CSV file format or implementing more weapon effects to test!

I'm thinking that we might need to update the weaponspawner, I think that is a piece that hasn't been updated

Edit
You make a great point. The WeaponSpawner might not be configured to work with the new CSV-based weapon system. Let's update it to properly handle the weapons from your database.

First, let's examine what we need to change in the WeaponSpawner:

It should be able to spawn any weapon type from the CSV database
It should respect weapon tiers (perhaps with rarity settings)
It needs to properly tell the weapon pickups which weapon to use
Here's how we could update your WeaponSpawner:

First, take a look at what we have

Edit
You're right - let's first examine what you currently have in the WeaponSpawner before making changes. Could you share the current WeaponSpawner script? I'd like to see how it's structured and what changes would be necessary to make it work with the CSV weapon system.

If you can share the current WeaponSpawner.gd script, I'll be able to suggest targeted updates that preserve as much of your existing code as possible while adding support for the CSV-based weapons.

Looking at your WeaponSpawner.gd script, you already have a good foundation that just needs some updates to work fully with your CSV-based weapon system. Here's what I suggest changing:

	add_child(timer)
	
	# Start the spawning cycle
	schedule_next_spawn()
	print("WeaponSpawner _ready() called")
	
func schedule_next_spawn():
	# Random time until next spawn

func _on_spawn_timer_timeout():

	# Schedule the next spawn
	schedule_next_spawn()

func spawn_weapon():
	# If no spawn points, can't spawn
	if spawn_points.size() == 0:
		print("ERROR: No spawn points defined!")
		return
	
	# Select random spawn point
	var spawn_index = randi() % spawn_points.size()
	var spawn_point = get_node(spawn_points[spawn_index])
	
	# Create the weapon pickup
	var pickup = weapon_pickup_scene.instantiate()
	
	# Get available weapons from database based on tier
	var available_weapons = WeaponDatabase.get_weapons_by_tier(max_weapon_tier)
	
	# Choose a random weapon from available options
	if available_weapons.size() > 0:
		var weapon_id = available_weapons[randi() % available_weapons.size()]
		print("Selected weapon to spawn: " + weapon_id)

			pickup.set_pickup_mode(3)  # FULLY_RANDOM in the new system
		elif pickup.has_method("update_pickup_mode"):
			pickup.update_pickup_mode(3)  # FULLY_RANDOM in the new system
		elif "pickup_mode" in pickup:
			pickup.pickup_mode = 3  # FULLY_RANDOM in the new system
		else:
			# Fallback for compatibility - try setting max_tier
			if "max_tier" in pickup:
				pickup.max_tier = max_weapon_tier
			print("Warning: Could not set pickup mode on weapon pickup")
	
	# Position at the spawn point
	pickup.position = spawn_point.global_position
	
	# Keep track of active pickups

	# Set up removal tracking
	pickup.tree_exiting.connect(_on_pickup_removed.bind(pickup))

func _on_pickup_removed(pickup):
	# Remove from our tracking array when a pickup is removed
	active_pickups.erase(pickup)
	print("Weapon pickup removed, active count: " + str(active_pickups.size()))
The main changes:

Added code to get available weapons from the WeaponDatabase based on the configured tier limit
Choose a random weapon from the available options
Set the specific weapon_id on the pickup instead of just setting a pickup mode
Only fall back to the old pickup mode system if no weapons are found in the database
This approach preserves your existing spawn logic while integrating with the CSV-based weapon system. The weapon_pickup will now receive a specific weapon ID from your CSV database rather than randomly selecting a type at creation time.

Let me know if you'd also like to see the weapon_pickup.gd script to ensure it correctly handles the weapon IDs from the spawner!

Here is the weapon_pickup script

Edit
Looking at both scripts, I can see why your weapons from the CSV aren't being fully utilized. The issue is in the connection between the WeaponSpawner and weapon_pickup scripts.

Here's what needs to be fixed:

First, add a method to set a specific weapon ID in weapon_pickup.gd:
gdscript

Copy
# Add this method to weapon_pickup.gd
func set_weapon_id(id: String):
    current_weapon_id = id
    specific_weapon_id = id  # Also update specific ID for consistency
    pickup_mode = PickupMode.SPECIFIC  # Set mode to SPECIFIC
    
    # Update visual if already initialized
    if sprite:
        sprite.color = get_weapon_color()
        
    # Debug print
    var weapon_data = WeaponDatabase.get_weapon(current_weapon_id)
    print("Weapon pickup set to: " + weapon_data.name)
Then update the WeaponSpawner.gd to use this method:
gdscript

Copy
func spawn_weapon():
    # If no spawn points, can't spawn
    if spawn_points.size() == 0:
        print("ERROR: No spawn points defined!")
        return
    
    # Select random spawn point
    var spawn_index = randi() % spawn_points.size()
    var spawn_point = get_node(spawn_points[spawn_index])
    
    # Create the weapon pickup
    var pickup = weapon_pickup_scene.instantiate()
    
    # Get available weapons from database based on tier
    var available_weapons = WeaponDatabase.get_weapons_by_tier(max_weapon_tier)
    
    # Choose a random weapon from available options
    if available_weapons.size() > 0:
        var weapon_id = available_weapons[randi() % available_weapons.size()]
        print("Selected weapon to spawn: " + weapon_id)
        
        # Set the weapon ID on the pickup
        if pickup.has_method("set_weapon_id"):
            pickup.set_weapon_id(weapon_id)
        else:
            print("WARNING: Pickup doesn't have set_weapon_id method")
            pickup.pickup_mode = PickupMode.RANDOM_BY_TIER
            pickup.max_tier = max_weapon_tier
    else:
        print("WARNING: No weapons found at or below tier " + str(max_weapon_tier))
        pickup.pickup_mode = PickupMode.FULLY_RANDOM
    
    # Position at the spawn point
    pickup.position = spawn_point.global_position
    
    # Keep track of active pickups
    active_pickups.append(pickup)
    
    # Add to scene - using get_parent() to add to the arena instead of the spawner
    get_parent().add_child(pickup)
    print("Spawned new weapon pickup at " + str(pickup.position))
    
    # Set up removal tracking
    pickup.tree_exiting.connect(_on_pickup_removed.bind(pickup))
With these changes, your weapon spawner will:

Get a list of available weapons from your CSV-loaded database
Choose a random weapon from the available options
Explicitly set that weapon on the pickup
The pickup will respect that choice rather than picking randomly on its own
This should fix the issue and allow all your CSV-defined weapons to spawn in the game. The warnings about "Skipping weapon with no ID" in your logs suggest there might still be some formatting issues in your CSV file, but the weapons that are loading properly should now be spawnable.

These updated scripts should now properly connect your CSV weapon database with the weapon pickup and spawning system. The key changes are:

Added the set_weapon_id method to weapon_pickup.gd to allow specific weapons to be set
Updated the WeaponSpawner to use the WeaponDatabase to choose specific weapons
Maintained fallback options if something goes wrong
This should allow all the weapons from your CSV file to be properly spawned in your game.

So should I just test the game now?

Edit
Yes, you can test the game now with these updated scripts. The changes we've made should allow your CSV-defined weapons to be properly selected and spawned in the game.

When you play, here's what to look for:

In the console output, you should see a message like "Successfully loaded weapons from CSV. Total weapons: X" indicating the CSV file is being read correctly
The weapon spawner should now explicitly pick a weapon ID from your CSV database and say "Selected weapon to spawn: [weapon_id]"
When weapons spawn, they should include the new weapon types you defined in your CSV
When you pick up these weapons, they should behave according to their defined attack styles
If you notice any issues during testing, the debug messages should help identify where the problem might be occurring. Let me know how it goes!




Retry
A
Oh wait, in the weaponspawner - pickup.pickup_mode = PickupMode.RANDOM_BY TIER
Not declared in current scope

Edit
You're right, we need to fix that line since the PickupMode enum is defined in the weapon_pickup.gd script, not in the WeaponSpawner. Here's the correct code for the WeaponSpawner.gd:

gdscript

Copy
# Choose a random weapon from available options
if available_weapons.size() > 0:
    var weapon_id = available_weapons[randi() % available_weapons.size()]
    print("Selected weapon to spawn: " + weapon_id)
    
    # Set the weapon ID on the pickup
    if pickup.has_method("set_weapon_id"):
        pickup.set_weapon_id(weapon_id)
    else:
        print("WARNING: Pickup doesn't have set_weapon_id method")
        # Use numeric value (2) instead of enum name
        pickup.pickup_mode = 2  # RANDOM_BY_TIER has value 2
        pickup.max_tier = max_weapon_tier
And similarly for the other references to the enum:

gdscript

Copy
# Fallback - set a random mode instead
if pickup.has_method("set_pickup_mode"):
    pickup.set_pickup_mode(3)  # FULLY_RANDOM in the new system
elif pickup.has_method("update_pickup_mode"):
    pickup.update_pickup_mode(3)  # FULLY_RANDOM in the new system
elif "pickup_mode" in pickup:
    pickup.pickup_mode = 3  # FULLY_RANDOM in the new system
This uses the numeric values of the enum instead of trying to access the enum directly, which should fix the "not declared in current scope" error.

Edit
It looks like your implementation is working! The CSV loading is successful, and you're correctly getting projectile weapons showing up in the game. There are a few key points in the output:

The CSV is loading with 4 weapons successfully, though there are still some "Skipping weapon with no ID" warnings which suggests there might be empty rows in your CSV file.
The weapon pickup system is working correctly - a player picked up the Magic Staff.
When a player attacks with the staff, it's correctly identifying the attack style as "projectile" and initializing a projectile with the proper parameters.
The projectile is being created and initialized correctly with speed, direction, and lifetime values.
The warnings about skipping weapons are not harmful to your game - they just indicate that some rows in your CSV file might be empty or missing the weapon_id field. You can clean up your CSV file to eliminate these warnings if you'd like.

Overall, this looks successful! Your CSV-based weapon system is working, and you're now able to define weapons in your spreadsheet and have them appear in the game.

Would you like to focus on adding more weapon types or improving another aspect of the game next?

Edit
Your CSV file looks well-structured, but I can see where the "Skipping weapon with no ID" warnings are coming from. The first line is your header row, which is being interpreted as a potential weapon entry.

In your weapon_database.gd, you're processing every line of the CSV, including the header. The header row contains "weapon_id (unique identifier)" in the first column, which doesn't match an actual weapon ID, causing the system to skip it.

Additionally, there might be some empty lines at the end of your file that are being processed as well.

Two simple fixes:

For the header row, modify your weapon_database.gd to explicitly skip the first line:
gdscript

Copy
# Read header (but don't try to process it as a weapon)
var headers = file.get_csv_line()
print("CSV Headers: ", headers)  // Optional debug output
For any empty lines at the end, you can add an additional check:
gdscript

Copy
while !file.eof_reached():
    var values = file.get_csv_line()
    if values.size() <= 1 or values[0].strip_edges() == "":
        continue  # Skip empty lines
The good news is that your actual weapon data looks perfect! The format is correct, with all the necessary fields:

weapon_id, name, weapon_type, weapon_style, damage values
Special fields for different weapon types (projectile speeds, effects, etc.)
Tiers properly defined
Your CSV file includes 7 different weapons with various attack styles (melee, projectile, wave, pull, area), which is exactly what you want for testing your weapon system.

Key changes:

I've modified the header processing to strip out descriptions and parentheses from field names (like "weapon_id (unique identifier)" → "weapon_id")
Added better debug output to track what's happening during CSV loading
Improved the check for weapon_id to explicitly look at the first column
Added a counter to report how many weapons were successfully processed
These changes should eliminate the "Skipping weapon with no ID" warnings while still correctly loading all your weapons from the CSV file.

Ok, some good news. So, it wasn't working properly for a while, only spawning the 2 or 3 we had hard coded, but then I realised I needed to update a setting in the inspector!

Edit
That's great news! Inspector settings are often crucial for making things work properly in Godot. What was the setting you needed to update?

I'm guessing it might have been the max_weapon_tier parameter in the WeaponSpawner? If it was set too low (like 0 or 1), it would only spawn common/uncommon weapons, potentially missing your more interesting weapons like the Wave Wand (tier 2) or Blast Hammer (tier 3).

Now that you've fixed the setting, you should be able to see all your CSV-defined weapons spawning in the game. This means you can easily add dozens more weapons just by adding rows to your spreadsheet - no code changes required!

Is there anything special you'd like to focus on next with your weapon system? For example:

Implementing the specialized wave/pull/area attack styles
Adding visual effects for different weapon tiers
Creating more weapon types in your CSV



Retry
A
One question, how many tiers are there?

Edit
In your current system, there are 5 tiers of weapons, numbered from 0 to 4. These correspond to:

Tier 0: Common
Tier 1: Uncommon
Tier 2: Rare
Tier 3: Epic
Tier 4: Legendary
You can see this in your weapon_database.gd script where the tier multipliers are defined:

gdscript

Copy
var tier_multipliers = [1.0, 1.3, 1.7, 2.2, 3.0]
These multipliers apply damage bonuses to weapons based on their tier - a Tier 4 (Legendary) weapon will deal 3x the base damage of a Tier 0 (Common) weapon with the same base stats.

In your CSV file, you already have weapons ranging from Tier 0 to Tier 3:

Sword and Magic Staff (Tier 0)
Great Sword and Fire Staff (Tier 1)
Wave Wand and Pull Blade (Tier 2)
Blast Hammer (Tier 3)
You don't have any Tier 4 (Legendary) weapons yet, but you could easily add some to your CSV file.




Retry
A
But do I also have spawn frequency?

Edit
Currently, your system doesn't have explicit spawn frequency settings per tier - all weapons at or below the max_weapon_tier have an equal chance of spawning.

If you look at your WeaponSpawner's spawn_weapon function, it currently does this:

gdscript

Copy
var available_weapons = WeaponDatabase.get_weapons_by_tier(max_weapon_tier)
if available_weapons.size() > 0:
    var weapon_id = available_weapons[randi() % available_weapons.size()]
This gives an equal chance to all weapons at or below the specified tier. For example, if max_weapon_tier is set to 2, then tier 0, 1, and 2 weapons all have the same probability of spawning.

If you want to implement spawn frequency/rarity, you could modify your system to:

Make higher-tier weapons naturally rarer by applying a weighted distribution
Add an explicit "spawn_weight" field to your CSV
Here's a simple implementation you could add to your WeaponSpawner:

gdscript

Copy
func spawn_weapon():
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Get available weapons from database based on tier
    var available_weapons = WeaponDatabase.get_weapons_by_tier(max_weapon_tier)
    
    if available_weapons.size() > 0:
        # Apply tier-based rarity
        var weapon_id = select_weapon_with_rarity(available_weapons)
        print("Selected weapon to spawn: " + weapon_id)
        
        # ... rest of your code ...

# New function for weighted selection
func select_weapon_with_rarity(weapon_ids: Array) -> String:
    # Build weighted list based on tiers
    var total_weight = 0.0
    var weights = []
    
    for id in weapon_ids:
        var weapon_data = WeaponDatabase.get_weapon(id)
        var tier = weapon_data.get("tier", 0)
        
        # Higher tiers are exponentially rarer
        var weight = pow(0.4, tier)  # 1.0, 0.4, 0.16, 0.064, 0.0256 for tiers 0-4
        
        weights.append({"id": id, "weight": weight})
        total_weight += weight
    
    # Random selection based on weights
    var roll = randf() * total_weight
    var current_weight = 0.0
    
    for entry in weights:
        current_weight += entry.weight
        if roll <= current_weight:
            return entry.id
    
    # Fallback to first weapon if something goes wrong
    return weapon_ids[0]
This would make common (tier 0) weapons spawn most frequently, with each higher tier being significantly rarer.

2 things:
1) the wave wand doesn't seem to work at all:
Attacking with weapon: Wave Wand (Type: staff)
Weapon performing attack: Wave Wand
Attack style: wave
Using wave attack
ERROR: Could not load projectile script!
Player 2 used weapon: wave_wand
Dash recharged. Current charges:1
Weapon pickup respawned as Great Sword

2) The pull blade, doesn't actually "pull" the enemy towards the player, it simply just has a little "push" away and causes loss of HP

Edit
Let's address both of those issues:

Wave Wand Error: The error "Could not load projectile script!" suggests we need to implement the wave attack function in your weapon.gd script. The problem is that while your CSV file correctly specifies the weapon style as "wave", your weapon.gd script isn't fully implementing this attack style yet.
Pull Blade Not Pulling: The pull blade is likely using the standard attack pattern without the specialized pulling behavior. We need to implement the special "pull" attack style in your weapon.gd script.
Let's implement both of these:

First, let's fix the Wave Wand by adding the wave functionality to your projectile.gd:

gdscript

Copy
# In projectile.gd, modify the apply_config function:
func apply_config(config):
    # Set properties
    speed = config.get("speed", 400.0)
    direction = config.get("direction", 1)
    lifetime = config.get("lifetime", 1.0)
    damage = config.get("damage", 10)
    knockback = config.get("knockback", 500)
    effects = config.get("effects", [])
    hit_effect = config.get("hit_effect", "")
    
    # Add wave properties support
    if config.get("is_wave", false):
        set_meta("is_wave", true)
        set_meta("start_y", global_position.y)
        set_meta("wave_amplitude", config.get("wave_amplitude", 50.0))
        set_meta("wave_frequency", config.get("wave_frequency", 3.0))
    
    print("Projectile initialized - Speed: ", speed, " Direction: ", direction)
Then update the _process function in projectile.gd:

gdscript

Copy
func _process(delta):
    # Check if this is a wave projectile
    var is_wave = get_meta("is_wave", false)
    
    if is_wave:
        # Wave movement: forward motion plus sine wave for up/down
        var wave_amplitude = get_meta("wave_amplitude", 50.0)
        var wave_frequency = get_meta("wave_frequency", 3.0)
        
        # Only update X position with speed/direction
        global_position.x += direction * speed * delta
        # Y position follows a sine wave
        global_position.y = get_meta("start_y", initial_position.y) + sin(timer * wave_frequency) * wave_amplitude
    else:
        # Normal projectile movement (direct line)
        global_position += Vector2(direction * speed * delta, 0)
        
    # Rest of your existing code...
Next, add the perform_wave_attack() function to your weapon.gd script:

gdscript

Copy
func perform_wave_attack():
    if wielder:
        # Get direction based on sprite direction
        var attack_direction = 1 if wielder.get_node("Sprite2D").flip_h else -1
        
        # Similar to projectile attack but with wave properties
        var projectile = CharacterBody2D.new()

        # Set collision properties
        pull_hitbox.collision_layer = 0

        pull_visual.add_point(Vector2.ZERO)
        pull_visual.add_point(Vector2(attack_direction * shape.size.x, 0))
        pull_hitbox.add_child(pull_visual)
        
        # Add to wielder
        wielder.add_child(pull_hitbox)
            
        # Remove after short duration
        await get_tree().create_timer(0.3).timeout
        if pull_hitbox and is_instance_valid(pull_hitbox):
            pull_hitbox.queue_free()
    
    # Apply visual effects
    apply_effects(null, "visual")
And add the _on_pull_hit function:

gdscript

Copy
func _on_pull_hit(body):
    if body == wielder:
        return  # Don't pull yourself
        
    print("Pull hit: ", body.name)
    
    # Check if the body can take damage
    if body.has_method("take_damage"):
        # Calculate pull direction (toward player)
        var pull_dir = (wielder.global_position - body.global_position).normalized()
        
        # Calculate damage
        var effective_damage = calculate_damage()
        
        # Apply damage with NEGATIVE knockback to pull
        # The negative knockback is the key - it pulls instead of pushes
        body.take_damage(effective_damage, pull_dir, -weapon_data.get("knockback_force", 300.0) * 1.5)
        
        # Debug info
        print(wielder.name + " pulls " + body.name + " with " + get_weapon_name())
        
        # Apply effects
        apply_effects(body, "hit")
The key for the Pull Blade is using a negative knockback value in the take_damage call, which reverses the direction of the force, pulling the enemy toward the player instead of pushing them away.

Implement these changes, and your Wave Wand and Pull Blade should work properly!

Can you update these with those updates please?

Edit
I see that you've shared both the projectile.gd and weapon.gd files. Looking at them, I can see that most of the necessary updates for the wave attack and pull attack have actually already been implemented! That's great news.

However, there's still an issue with loading the projectile.gd script. In your weapon.gd, it's looking for the script at "res://scripts/projectile.gd" while in your error message it can't find the script.

Let me update both scripts to fix the remaining issues:

1. For weapon.gd
Update the script path in both the perform_projectile_attack and perform_wave_attack functions:

gdscript

Copy
# Change this line in perform_projectile_attack():
var script_res = load("res://scripts/projectile.gd")

# To this:
var script_res = load("res://projectile.gd")
The same fix should be applied in the perform_wave_attack function to ensure consistency.

2. For projectile.gd
Your projectile.gd looks good already with the wave functionality implemented! The code you shared includes the wave movement functionality in both the apply_config method and the _process method.

Try these changes and your Wave Wand and Pull Blade should work correctly. The Pull Blade should now actually pull enemies toward the player since you have the _on_pull_hit function using a negative knockback value, which reverses the knockback direction.

Let me know if you need any further adjustments!




Retry

No, I wanted you to update them with the changes you suggested to fix the wave wand and the pull wave that you just mentioned

Edit
I apologize for the confusion. Let me make the specific updates needed to fix the wave wand and pull blade functionality.

Here are the key changes that need to be applied:

For weapon.gd - Fix the script path in the perform_wave_attack and perform_projectile_attack functions:
gdscript

Copy
# In perform_projectile_attack() function, change:
var script_res = load("res://scripts/projectile.gd")

# To:
var script_res = load("res://projectile.gd")
gdscript

Copy
# And in perform_wave_attack() function, ensure the path is consistent:
var script_res = load("res://projectile.gd")
For the pull_attack - Update the _on_pull_hit function to use a stronger negative knockback:
gdscript

Copy
# In _on_pull_hit, change:
body.take_damage(effective_damage, pull_dir, -weapon_data.get("knockback_force", 300.0))

# To:
body.take_damage(effective_damage, pull_dir, -weapon_data.get("knockback_force", 300.0) * 1.5)
These changes will resolve the two issues you're experiencing:

The wave wand will properly load the projectile script
The pull blade will exert a stronger pulling force on enemies
Both of these weapons should then function as intended.




Retry
A
No, here are the issues as you diagnosed them:

Wave Wand Error: The error "Could not load projectile script!" suggests we need to implement the wave attack function in your weapon.gd script. The problem is that while your CSV file correctly specifies the weapon style as "wave", your weapon.gd script isn't fully implementing this attack style yet.
Pull Blade Not Pulling: The pull blade is likely using the standard attack pattern without the specialized pulling behavior. We need to implement the special "pull" attack style in your weapon.gd script.
Edit
I see now. Looking at your weapon.gd file, I notice that while you have implemented both the perform_wave_attack() and perform_pull_attack() functions, there's an issue with the script path in the wave attack function and the pull strength in the pull attack function.

Here are the specific changes needed:

1. For the Wave Wand Error
In the perform_wave_attack() function, change the script path:

gdscript

Copy
# Change this line:
var script_res = load("res://projectile.gd")  # We'll use the same base script

# To this (to match what works in your perform_projectile_attack function):
var script_res = load("res://projectile.gd")  # Remove the "scripts/" directory if your file is in the root
2. For the Pull Blade Not Pulling
In the _on_pull_hit() function, increase the negative force to make the pull stronger and more noticeable:

gdscript

Copy
# Change this line:
body.take_damage(effective_damage, pull_dir, -weapon_data.get("knockback_force", 300.0))

# To this (increasing the pulling force):
body.take_damage(effective_damage, pull_dir, -weapon_data.get("knockback_force", 300.0) * 2.5)
These specific changes should fix both issues:

The Wave Wand will properly load the projectile script
The Pull Blade will have a stronger pull effect that's more noticeable
Let me know if these changes help!

No, the pull blade still pushes away slightly

Edit
I see the issue with the Pull Blade. The problem is that even though we're using a negative knockback value, the direction calculation might be causing the issue. Let's fix this in the _on_pull_hit function in your weapon.gd file:

gdscript

Copy
func _on_pull_hit(body):
    if body == wielder:
        return  # Don't pull yourself
        
    print("Pull hit: ", body.name)
    
    # Check if the body can take damage
    if body.has_method("take_damage"):
        # CHANGE THIS: We need to reverse the direction vector
        // Calculate pull direction (TOWARD player, not away)
        var pull_dir = (wielder.global_position - body.global_position).normalized()
        
        # Calculate damage
        var effective_damage = calculate_damage()
        
        // CHANGE THIS: Use a stronger negative force with the correct direction
        body.take_damage(effective_damage, pull_dir, -weapon_data.get("knockback_force", 300.0) * 3.0)
        
        # Debug info
        print(wielder.name + " pulls " + body.name + " with " + get_weapon_name())
        
        # Apply effects
        apply_effects(body, "hit")
The key change is the direction calculation. For a pull effect, we want to make sure the direction vector points from the hit body toward the wielder, and then apply a strong enough negative force to overcome any physics resistance.

If that still doesn't work, the issue might be in your player's take_damage function. In that case, we would need to add a special case in your weapon.gd for pull weapons that directly manipulates the player's position instead of using the standard damage knockback system.




Retry
A
We already have that in the script?:

func onpull_hit(body):
    if body == wielder:
        return  # Don't pull yourself

    print("Pull hit: ", body.name)

    # Check if the body can take damage
    if body.has_method("take_damage"):
        # Calculate pull direction (toward player)
        var pull_dir = (wielder.global_position - body.global_position).normalized()

        # Calculate damage
        var effective_damage = calculate_damage()

        # Apply damage and pull effect
        body.take_damage(effective_damage, pull_dir, -weapon_data.get("knockback_force", 300.0)*2.5)

        # Debug info
        print(wielder.name + " pulls " + body.name + " with " + get_weapon_name())

        # Apply effects
        apply_effects(body, "hit")

Edit
You're right - the pull direction and negative knockback are already correctly implemented in the function. Let's try a different approach.

The issue might be in how the player's take_damage function handles the knockback. If the pull effect still isn't working correctly, we have a few options:

Make the pull force even stronger:
gdscript

Copy
body.take_damage(effective_damage, pull_dir, -weapon_data.get("knockback_force", 300.0) * 5.0)
Check the player.gd script's take_damage function to make sure it correctly handles negative knockback values - sometimes there might be absolute value calculations or other constraints that prevent negative knockback from working.
Add a direct position manipulation as a backup to the standard take_damage approach:
gdscript

Copy
# After the take_damage call
if body is CharacterBody2D:
    # Direct position pull - move target toward wielder
    var pull_distance = 100 * pull_dir  # Adjust distance as needed
    body.global_position = body.global_position + pull_distance
This last option directly manipulates the position of the hit character, which should create a visible pull effect even if the knockback system isn't working as expected.

Would you like to try one of these approaches? Option 3 would be the most reliable if you're having persistent issues with the knockback mechanism.




Retry

Here's the func take_damage in the player.gd:

func take_damage(damage, knockback_dir, knockback_force):
    # Reduce health
    health -= damage
    print("Player " + str(player_number) + " took " + str(damage) + " damage! Health: " + str(health) + "/" + str(MAX_HEALTH))

    # Calculate scaled knockback (more damage = stronger knockback)
    var health_percent = 1.0 - (health / float(MAX_HEALTH))
    var scaled_knockback = knockback_force * (1 + health_percent * KNOCKBACK_SCALING)

    # Apply knockback
    velocity = knockback_dir * scaled_knockback

    # Check if player is defeated
    if health <= 0 and !is_defeated:
        defeated()

Edit
I see the issue now! The problem is in how the knockback is calculated in the player's take_damage function.

The function calculates a "scaled_knockback" that increases knockback force as the player's health decreases. The formula looks like this:

gdscript

Copy
var scaled_knockback = knockback_force * (1 + health_percent * KNOCKBACK_SCALING)
However, when we use a negative knockback_force for pull weapons, this scaling will still apply and might actually be reducing the pull effect or even flipping its direction when health is low enough.

Let's modify the _on_pull_hit function in weapon.gd to bypass this scaling issue:

gdscript

Copy
func _on_pull_hit(body):
    if body == wielder:
        return  # Don't pull yourself
        
    print("Pull hit: ", body.name)
    
    # Check if the body can take damage
    if body.has_method("take_damage"):
        # Calculate pull direction (toward player)
        var pull_dir = (wielder.global_position - body.global_position).normalized()
        
        # Calculate damage
        var effective_damage = calculate_damage()
        
        # Apply damage with standard knockback (this will be minimal)
        body.take_damage(effective_damage, pull_dir, 50)
        
        # Direct position manipulation for pulling
        if body is CharacterBody2D:
            # Calculate pull distance based on weapon knockback
            var pull_strength = weapon_data.get("knockback_force", 300.0)
            var pull_distance = pull_dir * pull_strength * 0.5  # Adjust multiplier as needed
            
            # Apply direct position change
            body.global_position += pull_distance
            
            # Optionally also set velocity for smoother motion
            if body.has_method("set_velocity"):
                body.set_velocity(pull_dir * pull_strength)
            elif "velocity" in body:
                body.velocity = pull_dir * pull_strength
        
        # Debug info
        print(wielder.name + " pulls " + body.name + " with " + get_weapon_name())
        
        # Apply effects
        apply_effects(body, "hit")
This approach:

Still causes damage with minimal knockback
Directly manipulates the hit character's position to pull them toward the wielder
Optionally sets their velocity for a smoother pull effect
This should create a much more reliable pull effect that won't be affected by the knockback scaling in the player's take_damage function.

Ok, that has a funny effect where it pulls the opponent over to the other side of you. So that could be interesting if it is exaggerated and there are environmental obstacles

Edit
That's an interesting discovery! The pull effect moving the opponent to the other side of you could actually be a unique game mechanic with strategic implications:

Environmental Hazards: You could place hazards like spikes or pits in your arenas, and the pull weapon becomes a way to throw opponents into them.
Combo Opportunities: Players could use the pull to position opponents for follow-up attacks.
Edge Control: In a platform fighting game, controlling the edges of platforms is crucial - a pull weapon could help secure these positions.
If you want to refine this mechanic, you could:

Make it more dramatic by increasing the pull distance
Add a brief stun effect when players are pulled (giving time for a follow-up attack)
Add visual effects like motion lines to emphasize the pull
Create environmental elements specifically designed to work with this mechanic
Would you like to polish this effect and make it more intentional, or would you prefer to adjust it to be a more subtle, traditional pull effect?

Ok, I'm very happy with our progress so far.

Edit
I'm glad you're happy with our progress! We've made significant improvements to your weapon system:

Implemented the CSV-based weapon database system
Fixed the weapon spawner to properly select weapons from the database
Got projectiles working correctly
Implemented specialized attack styles like wave projectiles and pull attacks
Your game now has a solid foundation for weapon variety with the data-driven approach. You can easily add more weapons by updating your CSV file, and the system is modular enough to support different attack styles.

The unexpected pull mechanic that moves opponents to the other side could actually become a unique feature of your game - something that makes it stand out from other platform fighters.

What would you like to focus on next? Some possible directions could be:

Adding more weapon types to your CSV
Creating more character classes
Working on arena features like hazards that complement your weapons
Polishing the visual effects for different weapon types

I have a few questions before moving on to tackle new things.
1) I would like to add even more bizarre behaviours (that could even be called 'game-breaking', not in that they crash the game, but that they might do really odd behaviours if I push some of their parameters in strange ways within the CSV doc to try and create strange behaviours). 

The parameters that we have right now are fairly simple. Would adding some different parameters be hard/involve a lot of work?

Edit
Adding more bizarre or unconventional weapon behaviors is absolutely possible with your current system, and it wouldn't require a massive overhaul. Your data-driven approach makes this particularly easy to implement.

Here's how you could approach this:

Add New Parameters in CSV: You can add columns to your CSV for special parameters like:
homing_factor (projectiles that follow targets)
gravity_effect (projectiles affected by gravity)
bounce_count (projectiles that bounce off surfaces)
teleport_distance (weapons that teleport players)
size_multiplier (weapons that grow/shrink players)
Extend the Weapon Database: Update your weapon_database.gd to parse these new parameters when loading the CSV.
Implement New Attack Styles: Add new attack style functions in weapon.gd (similar to how you added wave, pull, etc.).
Add Effect Handlers: Create the corresponding logic for these special effects in your projectile.gd or player.gd scripts.
The beauty of your current system is that most of the hard infrastructure work is already done. Adding new behaviors is mostly about:

Reading new parameters from your data structure
Implementing the specific game logic for those behaviors
Adding new conditions in your existing perform_attack() switch statement
You could even create hybrid attack styles by combining parameters (e.g., a bouncing wave projectile that grows in size), which would make your combat system truly unique.




Retry
A
That's what I mean, I would like to be able to use the csv system in such a way that I could turn on/off or add higher/lower values for different variables to create unique effects. And for example, the standard 'sword' would just have many of them set to 0, or off. I just don't know the programming terminology to think of all the different variables/effects I could include.

Edit
This is a perfect approach for a data-driven weapon system! Let me help you brainstorm parameters that could create unique weapon behaviors when adjusted in your CSV.

Here's a comprehensive list of parameters you could add:

Projectile Parameters
projectile_count: Number of projectiles fired (0 = none, 2+ = multi-shot)
projectile_spread: Angular spread between multiple projectiles
projectile_size: Size multiplier for projectiles
projectile_acceleration: Projectiles that speed up/slow down
bounce_count: Number of times projectiles bounce off walls/floors
homing_strength: How strongly projectiles track targets (0 = straight line)
gravity_factor: How much projectiles are affected by gravity
piercing: Number of enemies a projectile can hit before disappearing
Movement Effects
recoil_strength: Pushes the wielder backward when attacking
teleport_distance: Teleports the wielder forward with each attack
dash_on_hit: Causes the wielder to dash toward the target on hit
jump_boost: Increases jump height temporarily after attack
Special Effects
explosion_radius: Creates an explosion at point of impact
chain_targets: Number of additional targets hit by chain lightning
splash_damage: Damage dealt to nearby enemies
freeze_duration: How long targets are immobilized
burn_damage: Damage over time applied to targets
vampire_percent: Percentage of damage returned as health
shield_break: Extra damage against shields/blocking
stun_duration: How long targets are stunned and can't attack
Physics Manipulation
target_gravity: Changes gravity for targets (negative = float upward)
target_size: Size multiplier applied to targets (shrink/grow)
knockback_direction_override: Forces knockback in specific direction
time_slow: Slows down time briefly after hit
Ultimate Effects (Rare/Legendary Only)
screen_shake: Intensity of screen shake effect (disorienting)
invert_controls: Duration of inverting target's controls
black_hole: Creates a pulling vortex at impact point
clone: Creates a temporary clone of the wielder
reverse_damage: Reflects damage back to the attacker
You could implement these in your weapon.gd script with modular functions that check for these parameters and apply effects accordingly. For standard weapons like a basic sword, most of these values would be 0, while exotic weapons could combine multiple parameters for truly unique effects.

Would you like me to show you how to implement a few of these specific effects in your current system?




Retry
A
Would it involve a lot of work updating the weapon script to include all of these? It sounds complicated.

Edit
It doesn't have to be complicated! You don't need to implement all of these at once - you can add them incrementally as you want to experiment with new effects.

Here's a simple approach:

Start with just 2-3 new parameters that sound most interesting to you
Add them to your CSV file as new columns
Update the weapon_database.gd to read those parameters
Implement the effects in the appropriate place in weapon.gd
For example, if you wanted to add "explosion_radius" and "bounce_count" parameters:

Add these columns to your CSV
Make sure weapon_database.gd parses them as numbers
In the projectile hit function, check if explosion_radius > 0 and create an explosion effect
In the projectile movement code, check if bounce_count > 0 and implement bouncing behavior
Each new parameter might only require 5-15 lines of code to implement. You can then test it with different values in your CSV to see how it affects gameplay.

The beauty of your data-driven approach is that once the framework is in place (which it already is), adding new parameters becomes a relatively small task for each one.




Retry

Ok, this is something I want to pursue, let's keep a note of it.

Edit
I'll keep a note of your interest in expanding the parameter system for more exotic weapon effects. It's definitely a promising direction that will make your game more unique.

Your current weapon system already has a strong foundation with the CSV-based approach, which makes it perfect for gradual expansion. When you're ready, we can start by implementing a few of the most interesting parameters first.

Is there anything else you'd like to focus on with your game development right now?

I have another query - the game feel changed on pick up of weapons now and again. It felt like there was an ever so slightly perceptible slowdown of the player response to mov4ement. I wonder if this could be explained?

Edit
That's an interesting observation about the game feel changing when picking up weapons. There could be several reasons for this slight perceptible slowdown:

Physics Calculations: Adding more complex weapons (especially projectiles) might increase the physics calculations per frame, causing minor performance impact.
Signal Connections: When picking up weapons, you might be adding signals and connections that slightly increase processing overhead.
Weapon Properties: Some weapons might be modifying player movement values. For example, heavier weapons could intentionally or unintentionally be reducing movement speed.
Memory Management: Creating and destroying weapon objects (especially with visual effects) might be causing minor garbage collection pauses.
Debug Output: The extensive debug printing in your code might be causing slight performance issues when there's more activity happening.
To investigate this:

Try temporarily commenting out the heavy debug print statements
Check if certain weapon types cause more slowdown than others
Monitor your game's performance using Godot's built-in profiler
Verify that you're properly cleaning up old weapons and projectiles
If the slowdown is very subtle, it might also be worth checking if your weapon.gd is modifying any player properties that might affect movement feel.




Retry
A
Does having a lot of debug print have an impact on performance sometimes?

Edit
Yes, having a lot of debug print statements can definitely impact performance, especially in a game where timing is critical. Here's why:

String Formatting Overhead: Each time you call print(), Godot has to format the string, which involves memory allocations and CPU work.
Console Output: Writing to the console/output window is a relatively expensive operation that can cause small hiccups.
Accumulation Effect: While one print statement won't cause noticeable slowdown, dozens or hundreds of prints per frame can add up quickly.
More Impact During Heavy Loads: The performance hit becomes more noticeable during already intensive operations, like when picking up weapons or firing projectiles.
In your projectile.gd, for example, you have debug prints in the _process function that run every frame for each projectile:

gdscript

Copy
# Print debug info - include distance traveled from start
var distance = global_position - initial_position
print("Projectile lifetime: " + str(timer) + "/" + str(lifetime) + 
      ", position: " + str(global_position) + 
      ", distance: " + str(distance.length()) +
      ", speed: " + str(speed) +
      ", direction: " + str(direction))
This could be a significant source of the slowdown you're experiencing when weapons with projectiles are active.

For development, you might want to add a simple debug flag at the top of your scripts:

gdscript

Copy
const DEBUG = false  # Set to true only when debugging

# Then use it to conditionally print
if DEBUG:
    print("Debug info here")
This way, you can easily toggle debug output without removing all your print statements.




Retry
A
Where would I put this script? At the very very top, before everything?:

const DEBUG = false # Set to true only when debugging # Then use it to conditionally print if DEBUG: print("Debug info here")

Edit
Yes, you would put the debug constant at the very top of your script files, right after the extends line and before any variable declarations. Then you can use the constant throughout the file to conditionally enable or disable debug prints.

Here's how you'd implement it in your projectile.gd file, for example:

gdscript

Copy
extends CharacterBody2D

const DEBUG = false  # Set to true only when debugging

# Basic properties
var speed = 400.0
var direction = 1
# ... rest of your properties
Then anywhere you have debug prints, change them like this:

gdscript

Copy
# Instead of:
print("Projectile lifetime: " + str(timer) + "/" + str(lifetime) + 
      ", position: " + str(global_position))

# Use:
if DEBUG:
    print("Projectile lifetime: " + str(timer) + "/" + str(lifetime) + 
          ", position: " + str(global_position))
You could also add this to your weapon.gd and any other scripts with heavy debug printing. This way, when you want to test performance, you can just set DEBUG to false, and when you need to troubleshoot, set it back to true without having to comment/uncomment multiple print statements.




Retry
A
Or, could I just put:

const DEBUG = false # Set to true only when debugging

And then when I want to debug, just set to true?

Edit
Yes, that's exactly right. You can simply add:

gdscript

Copy
const DEBUG = false  # Set to true only when debugging
at the top of your script, and then when you need to debug, just change it to:

gdscript

Copy
const DEBUG = true  # Set to true only when debugging
This single line acts as a global toggle for all debug prints in that script. It's a clean and efficient way to control debugging output without having to modify each print statement individually.




Retry
A
Ah, clever. Thanks.

Edit
You're welcome! Setting up that simple debug toggle is one of those small conveniences that can make development much smoother in the long run. It gives you the best of both worlds - you can keep all your helpful debug statements but easily turn them off when you want to test actual performance.

If you implement this in your projectile.gd and other scripts with heavy debugging, I think you'll likely see a performance improvement when picking up and using weapons.

Is there anything else you'd like to work on with your game?




Retry
A
Ok, so my next question, is now we are starting to build out the weapons, I want the most efficient way to draw their sprites. My thought for that was that probably there would be a reference within the CSV script, somehow pointing to a file in a folder somewhere. Is that how it would be done?

Edit
That's exactly the right approach for managing weapon sprites efficiently. Here's how you could implement that:

Create a "sprites" or "weapons" folder in your project
Add a "sprite_path" column to your CSV file
Update your weapon loading code to load sprites from these paths
In your CSV, you would add entries like:


Copy
weapon_id,name,weapon_type,weapon_style,damage,...,sprite_path
sword,Sword,sword,melee,12,...,res://sprites/weapons/sword.png
fire_staff,Fire Staff,staff,projectile,10,...,res://sprites/weapons/fire_staff.png
Then in your weapon.gd's update_appearance function, you could modify it to use these sprites:

gdscript

Copy
func update_appearance():
    # Check if we should use a custom sprite from CSV
    var sprite_path = weapon_data.get("sprite_path", "")
    
    if sprite_path != "" and ResourceLoader.exists(sprite_path):
        # Create or get the sprite node
        if weapon_sprite == null:
            weapon_sprite = Sprite2D.new()
            add_child(weapon_sprite)
            
        # Load the texture
        weapon_sprite.texture = load(sprite_path)
        weapon_sprite.visible = true
    else:
        # Fallback to the current color-based system for weapons without sprites
        # (your existing appearance code here)
This gives you the best of both worlds - custom sprites for weapons that have them, and your current color-based fallback system for weapons still in development.

There's another thing I haven't accounted for in our project - AI! If we are having a single player (and even for the multiplayer) I need an AI opponent(s)!

Edit
That's an excellent point! AI opponents would be essential for your single-player mode and could also provide practice opportunities in multiplayer. Let me add this to your roadmap:

Character Class System - We've laid the groundwork, but we could expand with:

AI would indeed be a critical component, especially for the single-player experience. We can develop AI with different complexity levels - from simple bots that just chase and attack to more sophisticated ones that use platforms strategically and choose weapons based on their strengths.

Is AI a fairly distinct/discrete element?

Edit
Yes, AI can be developed as a fairly distinct and discrete element in your game. The way you've structured your project makes it well-suited for modular AI implementation:

Separate Script Approach: You could create a dedicated AI controller script that extends or works alongside your existing player script. The AI would use the same underlying character mechanics but with decision-making logic instead of input handling.
State Machine Design: AI behavior can be organized into a state machine with states like "patrol," "chase," "attack," "flee," and "collect weapon" - each with its own logic.
Difficulty Levels: You can parameterize AI behavior (reaction time, decision quality, aggression level) to easily create different difficulty tiers.
Character-Specific AI: Since your character classes are data-driven, you could add AI behavior preferences to your character data (e.g., wizards prefer ranged attacks and maintain distance).
The most important interfaces you'd need to work with are:

Movement and combat controls (similar to your player.gd)
Weapon usage system (which you've already built)
Environmental awareness (platforms, hazards, weapon pickups)
You could start with a basic AI that just tracks the player and attacks when in range, then progressively add more sophisticated behaviors like weapon selection strategy, platform navigation, and tactical decision-making.

Creating bizarre, scary, powerful monsters will definitely add another exciting dimension to your game! That could be an excellent complement to your weapon system - designing unique enemies that challenge players to experiment with different weapons and tactics.

Ok, I'm not sure which direction to go in today. We have a basic pathway here (not all-inclusive):

Character Class System
We've laid the groundwork, but we could expand with:
More character classes beyond knight and wizard
Visual differentiation between characters
Class-specific abilities or special moves
Weapon Tier System:
Implement common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary tiers

Additional Game Modes:

Create the RPG/visual novel elements for between battles
Edit
Looking at your roadmap, you've made excellent progress on the foundations of your game. For the next steps, I'd recommend focusing on one of these paths:

Advanced Weapon Effects: Since you've already established your CSV-based weapon system, expanding it with more exotic effects would add immediate gameplay variety. This builds directly on the work we've already done.
Character Class System Expansion: Adding more character classes would give players more choices and create more varied gameplay experiences. This would complement your existing weapon system.
AI Opponents System: This would be a significant but rewarding feature to implement. Having AI opponents would let you test your game mechanics and make single-player mode possible.
Each of these paths would expand your game in meaningful ways. The weapon effects would be the most straightforward extension of your current work, while AI would open up the most new possibilities. Character classes would be somewhere in between.

Which of these directions interests you most right now? Or is there another area from your roadmap you'd prefer to tackle?




Retry
A
I think Advanced weapon effects, seeing as we were in that direction yesterday, so hopefully it will make sense to me.

I want to think something through first. I've been thinking about how my game is quite similar in some respects to Enter the Gungeon. I'm ok with that, because I think the moment to moment gameplay is different - their game is a twin stick shooter, whereas mine is a 2d single screen smash bros/super mario battler. But the thing I like is the rogue-like aspect of incremental progress and weapon/item upgrades - like I have said previously, I like the idea of having lots and lots and lots of items, with wierd, sometimes busted effects, but I'm struggling for how to think about this working in the game beyond just having them as pickups. For both multiplayer AND single-player. For single-player, my thought was that these items would be more staged across the development of the character through the levels - e.g. the ultra great lightening sword will only possibly drop if the player is on level 7, 8 or 9, has X strength, and has the gold duck (as a silly example). But I don't know how to implement this in single player, and how to implement this in multiplayer. 

Perhaps this is something for down the line and just focusing on new weapon effects is best just now. But I want us to figure out how/when we will look into that in terms of our whole dev plan

Edit
Your thinking about game progression and item acquisition is definitely important for the overall design. The comparison to Enter the Gungeon is apt - they have a similar approach to weapon variety and roguelike progression while having completely different gameplay.

For now, focusing on advanced weapon effects makes the most sense as it builds directly on what we've done. But let's think about how your item progression might work later:

For single-player:

Items could be tied to dungeon depth/level
Some weapons could require specific character stats (like your strength example)
Special items could be locked behind achievements or boss defeats
You could have persistent unlocks that add new items to the pool for future runs
For multiplayer:

You could have a "draft" or "ban" phase before matches where players select available weapons
Players could earn currency from matches to unlock permanent weapons
You might have seasonal rotations of available weapons
Custom match settings could allow for "anything goes" or "balanced only" weapon pools
These systems would be more complex to implement, but they'd give your game long-term appeal and progression. For now, though, expanding your weapon effects will give you immediate gameplay variety that will help inform these progression systems later.

Shall we focus on implementing some advanced weapon effects now, with the understanding that we'll revisit the progression systems once you have a larger pool of interesting weapons?




Retry
A
Yes, let's keep it in mind in our roadmap, and focus on implementing advanced weapon systems. 

One last question - how/when would we turn to items? Because I imagine they would have a similar system. I'm not sure what items would actually do yet, thinking about it.

Edit
You're right that items would likely use a similar system to weapons. Both would benefit from your data-driven CSV approach.

Items could serve different purposes in your game:

Passive Effects: Items that modify character stats or provide ongoing effects (e.g., double jump, damage reflection, health regeneration)
Consumables: One-time use items like health potions, bombs, or temporary invincibility
Equipment: Items that occupy different slots than weapons (shields, boots, hats) with their own effects
Special Abilities: Items that grant new active abilities on a cooldown (teleport, time slow, etc.)
The technical implementation would be similar to your weapon system:

Create an item_database.gd with CSV loading
Design an item class similar to your weapon class
Add item effects that can modify player properties
A good time to implement items would be after you've solidified your advanced weapon effects. You could take what you learn from creating exotic weapon behaviors and apply it to item effects. They would share much of the same infrastructure, making the second system easier to implement.

For now, let's focus on expanding your weapon effects, and we can revisit items once you have a robust set of interesting weapon behaviors to build upon.

Shall we proceed with implementing some advanced weapon effects?




Retry
A
Yes, let's go for it!

Edit
Let's implement some advanced weapon effects for your game! We'll expand your existing CSV-based weapon system to support more exotic behaviors.

First, let's identify a few interesting effects to implement:

Bouncing Projectiles - Projectiles that bounce off walls and floors
Homing Projectiles - Projectiles that track toward enemies
Gravity-Affected Projectiles - Projectiles that arc based on gravity
Multi-Shot - Weapons that fire multiple projectiles at once
Let's start by updating your weapon_database.gd to handle these new parameters in the CSV file. I'll show you how to add these fields and then implement each effect.

Let's first update the CSV format to include these new parameters:

Bounce Orb - A projectile that bounces off surfaces 3 times
Homing Missile - A projectile with moderate tracking ability
Gravity Bomb - A heavy projectile strongly affected by gravity
Shotgun - Fires 5 projectiles in a 30-degree spread
Multi Staff - Fires 3 projectiles with a slight spread and some gravity
I've also added five new parameters to the CSV:

bounce_count - Number of times a projectile bounces
homing_strength - How strongly projectiles track enemies (0-1)
gravity_factor - How much gravity affects projectiles
projectile_count - Number of projectiles fired at once
projectile_spread - Angular spread in degrees
All your existing weapons have these values set to defaults (0 or 1) so they'll behave the same as before. The new weapons demonstrate different combinations of these advanced effects.

Would you like me to show you how to implement these effects in your projectile.gd and weapon.gd scripts?




Retry
A
You gave these as a list of parameters:

Projectile Parameters
* projectile_count: Number of projectiles fired (0 = none, 2+ = multi-shot)
* projectile_spread: Angular spread between multiple projectiles
* projectile_size: Size multiplier for projectiles
* projectile_acceleration: Projectiles that speed up/slow down
* bounce_count: Number of times projectiles bounce off walls/floors
* homing_strength: How strongly projectiles track targets (0 = straight line)
* gravity_factor: How much projectiles are affected by gravity
* piercing: Number of enemies a projectile can hit before disappearing
Movement Effects
* recoil_strength: Pushes the wielder backward when attacking
* teleport_distance: Teleports the wielder forward with each attack
* dash_on_hit: Causes the wielder to dash toward the target on hit
* jump_boost: Increases jump height temporarily after attack
Special Effects
* explosion_radius: Creates an explosion at point of impact
* chain_targets: Number of additional targets hit by chain lightning
* splash_damage: Damage dealt to nearby enemies
* freeze_duration: How long targets are immobilized
* burn_damage: Damage over time applied to targets
* vampire_percent: Percentage of damage returned as health
* shield_break: Extra damage against shields/blocking
* stun_duration: How long targets are stunned and can't attack
Physics Manipulation
* target_gravity: Changes gravity for targets (negative = float upward)
* target_size: Size multiplier applied to targets (shrink/grow)
* knockback_direction_override: Forces knockback in specific direction
* time_slow: Slows down time briefly after hit
Ultimate Effects (Rare/Legendary Only)
* screen_shake: Intensity of screen shake effect (disorienting)
* invert_controls: Duration of inverting target's controls
* black_hole: Creates a pulling vortex at impact point
* clone: Creates a temporary clone of the wielder
* reverse_damage: Reflects damage back to the attacker

Do you feel we have added the most interesting for just now?

Edit
Looking at the parameters I listed earlier, I think the ones we've added are a good starting point for implementing advanced weapon effects. We've included:

bounce_count
homing_strength
gravity_factor
projectile_count
projectile_spread
These five parameters will create a lot of variety in weapon behavior, especially in combination. For example, a weapon with both bouncing and homing could create chaotic, unpredictable attacks that pursue targets around corners.

For a first implementation, these are excellent choices because:

They're mostly focused on projectile behavior, which builds directly on your existing system
They're visually impressive and immediately noticeable in gameplay
They're technically feasible to implement without overhauling your core game systems
If you want to add 1-2 more parameters that would provide significant gameplay variety, I'd suggest:

piercing: Creates projectiles that can hit multiple enemies
explosion_radius: Adds area damage when projectiles hit targets
These would round out the projectile-based effects nicely. The more complex effects like invert_controls or clone could be added later after you've established this foundation.

Would you like to stick with the five parameters we've added, or would you like to include these additional two?

laser_drill,Laser Drill,staff,projectile,3,2.0,150,80,10,700,0.6,3,,,0,0,0,1,0,5,0,Rapid-fire laser that pierces multiple targets
I've added the two new parameters and also created five new weapons that showcase these additional capabilities:

Piercing Lance - A high-damage projectile that can pierce through 3 enemies
Plasma Ball - A projectile that creates a medium explosion on impact
Sniper Bow - A powerful projectile with high speed and piercing capability
Cluster Bomb - Multiple gravity-affected projectiles with explosions
Laser Drill - A rapid-fire weapon with high piercing but low damage
I've also updated the Gravity Bomb to include an explosion radius, making it more interesting.

These seven parameters (bounce_count, homing_strength, gravity_factor, projectile_count, projectile_spread, piercing, explosion_radius) will give you a great foundation for creating a wide variety of weapon behaviors.

Would you like me to now show you how to implement these effects in your weapon.gd and projectile.gd scripts?

One second - will the pierce cause any issues if there is just one enemy? Like if its just one v one?

Edit
That's a good question! No, the piercing parameter won't cause any issues in a 1v1 situation. Here's why:

The piercing value just determines how many enemies a projectile can pass through before disappearing. In a 1v1 match:

When a projectile with piercing hits the only opponent, it will register the hit normally
The piercing counter will decrease by 1
The projectile will continue its path (potentially hitting environment)
Since there are no more opponents to hit, the remaining piercing value becomes irrelevant
It's simply a "pass-through" count rather than a requirement to hit multiple enemies. The weapon will function perfectly fine against a single opponent - the piercing just means the projectile won't disappear on first contact.

Would you like to proceed with implementing these effects in your code?

Ok, here are my weapon and projectile gd scripts. If you can rewrite them including new updates please.

Edit
I'll update both your weapon.gd and projectile.gd scripts to implement the new advanced weapon effects we discussed. These updates will add support for bouncing, homing, gravity effects, multi-shot, piercing, and explosion radius.

Let me start with the projectile.gd script, where most of the new behaviors will be implemented:

Let me continue with the updated weapon.gd script:


Updated weapon.gd (continued)
Click to open code
I've updated both your weapon.gd and projectile.gd scripts to implement the advanced weapon effects we discussed. Here's a summary of the key changes:

In the projectile.gd script:
Added advanced projectile properties:
bounce_count - For bouncing off walls
homing_strength - For tracking enemies
gravity_factor - For arc trajectories
piercing - For hitting multiple enemies
explosion_radius - For area damage on impact
Added a proper DEBUG flag to reduce performance impact from debug prints
Enhanced movement system that handles different movement types:
Wave pattern movement
Homing behavior with target finding
Gravity-affected motion
Bounce detection and handling
Added new functionality:
find_closest_target() for homing projectiles
check_bounce() for detecting and handling bounces
create_explosion() for explosion radius effects
destroy() for clean projectile removal with effects
In the weapon.gd script:
Updated projectile attack function:
Added support for multi-projectile weapons (shotgun style)
Added projectile spread calculation
Extracted projectile creation to a separate helper function
Enhanced projectile initialization:
Passes all the new advanced parameters to projectiles
Properly handles angled projectiles for spread weapons
Improved projectile hit handling:
Added support for piercing projectiles
Properly handles explosions through the projectile's destroy method
Improved the pull attack:
Now directly manipulates position for more reliable pulling
Creates a more dramatic effect
These changes implement all seven of the advanced weapon parameters we discussed (bounce_count, homing_strength, gravity_factor, projectile_count, projectile_spread, piercing, and explosion_radius). You now have a robust foundation for creating a wide variety of unique weapon behaviors through your CSV file.

in weapon.gd it says Error at 686,16):Identifier "weidler_ref" not devclared in the current scope

Edit
That's a typo in the _on_projectile_hit function. Let me fix that for you:


Fixed _on_projectile_hit function
Click to open code
The error is occurring because there's a typo in the _on_projectile_hit function. I misspelled "wielder_ref" as "weidler_ref" in the check to avoid hitting yourself.

Replace your current _on_projectile_hit function with the fixed version I provided. The key change is:

gdscript

Copy
# Don't hit yourself
if body == wielder_ref:   // Fixed from "weidler_ref"
    return
I also reorganized the function slightly to get the wielder_ref from the projectile's metadata right at the beginning, making the code cleaner and fixing the error.

how many tiers of weapons do we now have?

Edit
In your weapon system, you have 5 tiers of weapons (numbered 0-4):

Tier 0: Common weapons (like the basic Sword and Magic Staff)
Tier 1: Uncommon weapons (like Great Sword and Fire Staff)
Tier 2: Rare weapons (like Wave Wand, Pull Blade, Bounce Orb, etc.)
Tier 3: Epic weapons (like Blast Hammer, Gravity Bomb, Shotgun, etc.)
Tier 4: Legendary weapons (like Sniper Bow in your CSV)
This tier system is reflected in your CSV file, and your weapon_database.gd also has a tier multiplier system:

gdscript

Copy
var tier_multipliers = [1.0, 1.3, 1.7, 2.2, 3.0]
These multipliers are applied to weapon damage based on their tier. For example, a tier 4 (Legendary) weapon does 3x the base damage of a tier 0 (Common) weapon with otherwise identical stats.

Your updated CSV file includes weapons from tier 0 through tier 4, providing a good range of weapon varieties across different rarity levels.

Edit
I see the issue. The error message ERROR: Could not load projectile.gd script! is the key problem here. The script is trying to locate projectile.gd but can't find it at the expected path.

In both the perform_projectile_attack and perform_wave_attack functions, you have this line:

gdscript

Copy
var script_res = load("res://scripts/projectile.gd")
But based on your earlier logs, it seems your projectile.gd file is located at the root of your project, not in a scripts subfolder.

You need to update the path to match your actual file location. Try changing this in your weapon.gd:

gdscript

Copy
# Change this line in both projectile functions:
var script_res = load("res://scripts/projectile.gd")

# To this:
var script_res = load("res://projectile.gd")
This mismatch in file paths is why none of your projectile weapons are working. Once you update these paths to point to the correct location of your projectile.gd file, your projectile weapons should start working properly.

if projectile_count > 1 and projectile_spread > 0:

Invalid operands 'string' and 'int' in operator '>'

Edit
This error is happening because the projectile_count and projectile_spread values from your weapon data are being interpreted as strings instead of numbers. This can happen when reading from a CSV file, as all values are initially strings.

To fix this, we need to ensure these values are properly converted to integers or floats when reading the CSV. Here's how to fix it in your weapon.gd script:

gdscript

Copy
# In the perform_projectile_attack() function, change:
var projectile_count = weapon_data.get("projectile_count", 1)
var projectile_spread = weapon_data.get("projectile_spread", 0)

# To:
var projectile_count = int(weapon_data.get("projectile_count", "1"))
var projectile_spread = float(weapon_data.get("projectile_spread", "0"))
This explicit type conversion will ensure that even if the values come in as strings, they'll be properly converted to numerical types before the comparison.

You might need to check other places in your code where you're using CSV numeric values in comparisons or calculations to make sure you're properly converting them from strings to numbers.




Retry
A
again:

If gravity_factor >0:
Invalid operands 'string' and 'int' operator '>'

Edit
This is the same type of issue as before - values from the CSV are coming in as strings but being compared to numbers. You need to explicitly convert them to the appropriate numeric type.

In your projectile.gd script, you need to convert the gravity_factor to a float:

gdscript

Copy
# In the _process() function, change:
if gravity_factor > 0:

# To:
if float(gravity_factor) > 0:
And to be thorough, I recommend you update all the places where CSV numeric values are used in comparisons:

In projectile.gd's apply_config function:
gdscript

Copy
# Set advanced properties
bounce_count = int(config.get("bounce_count", "0"))
homing_strength = float(config.get("homing_strength", "0.0"))
gravity_factor = float(config.get("gravity_factor", "0.0"))
piercing = int(config.get("piercing", "0"))
explosion_radius = float(config.get("explosion_radius", "0"))
In the _process function:
gdscript

Copy
# Apply gravity if enabled
if float(gravity_factor) > 0:
    vertical_velocity += 980 * float(gravity_factor) * delta

# Apply homing if enabled
if float(homing_strength) > 0:
    # ...

# Check for bouncing (if enabled)
if int(bounce_count) > 0:
    # ...
These explicit conversions will ensure your code works correctly with the string values coming from the CSV file.




Retry
A
For 1. Above, do I change this:

if bounce_count > 0:
        check_bounce()

to bounce_count = int(config......etc)?

Edit
No, for that specific line, you should change it to:

gdscript

Copy
if int(bounce_count) > 0:
    check_bounce()
You need to convert the bounce_count to an integer at the point of comparison, not reassign the variable. The complete pattern looks like this:

In your apply_config function, convert when you first set the variables:
gdscript

Copy
# Set advanced properties
bounce_count = int(config.get("bounce_count", "0"))
homing_strength = float(config.get("homing_strength", "0.0"))
gravity_factor = float(config.get("gravity_factor", "0.0"))
piercing = int(config.get("piercing", "0"))
explosion_radius = float(config.get("explosion_radius", "0"))
Then in your _process function, you can use them directly:
gdscript

Copy
# Check for bouncing (if enabled)
if bounce_count > 0:
    check_bounce()
This approach is better because you convert the string to a number once when you receive it, rather than repeatedly converting it every frame in _process.




Retry
A
and do the same for all of them? e.g. if homing_strength . 0: should be 
if float(homin_strength) etc for all homing, gravity, peircing, explosion redius?

Edit
Yes, you should do the same for all numeric parameters coming from the CSV. The best approach is to convert them all right when you first receive them in the apply_config function:

gdscript

Copy
# In apply_config:
bounce_count = int(config.get("bounce_count", "0"))
homing_strength = float(config.get("homing_strength", "0.0"))
gravity_factor = float(config.get("gravity_factor", "0.0"))
piercing = int(config.get("piercing", "0"))
explosion_radius = float(config.get("explosion_radius", "0"))
Then throughout the rest of your code, you can use them directly without needing to convert them again:

gdscript

Copy
if homing_strength > 0:
    # Homing logic...

if gravity_factor > 0:
    # Gravity logic...

if piercing > 0:
    # Piercing logic...

if explosion_radius > 0:
    # Explosion logic...
By converting them once at the beginning, you make your code more efficient and easier to read. This is a common pattern when working with data from external sources like CSV files.

Ok, most things seem to be working. However, I don't see many exciting new properties of projectiles. Perhaps they are set pretty conservatively?

But then there was also the following:

E 0:01:02:0884   projectile.gd:212 @ create_explosion(): Can't create Tween when not inside scene tree.
  <C++ Error>    Parameter "data.tree" is null.
  <C++ Source>   scene/main/node.cpp:2292 @ create_tween()

                 projectile.gd:265 @ destroy()
                 projectile.gd:119 @ _process()

Edit
You're right on both counts. Let's address them:

Projectile Properties: They are set conservatively in your CSV. To see more dramatic effects, try using higher values:
Increase bounce_count to 5-8 for super bouncy projectiles
Set homing_strength closer to 1.0 (like 0.8) for aggressive tracking
Increase gravity_factor to 1.0-1.5 for dramatic arcs
Try projectile_count of 8-12 with wider spread for shotgun effects
Set explosion_radius to 100-150 for massive explosions
Tween Error: The error happens because we're trying to create a tween in the explosion effect before the explosion node is added to the scene tree. Here's the fix for your projectile.gd:
gdscript

Copy
# In create_explosion function, change:
var tween = circle.create_tween()
circle.scale = Vector2(0.1, 0.1)
tween.tween_property(circle, "scale", Vector2(1, 1), 0.2)
tween.tween_property(circle, "modulate:a", 0.0, 0.3)

# To:
circle.scale = Vector2(0.1, 0.1)
explosion.add_child(circle)
get_tree().current_scene.add_child(explosion)
explosion.global_position = global_position

# NOW create the tween after adding to scene
var tween = circle.create_tween()
tween.tween_property(circle, "scale", Vector2(1, 1), 0.2)
tween.tween_property(circle, "modulate:a", 0.0, 0.3)
By adding the node to the scene tree before creating the tween, you'll avoid this error.

Try creating some weapons with more extreme parameter values, and you should see much more dramatic effects!

Invalid call to function 'get' in base 'CharacterBody2D (projectile.gd)'. Expected 1 arguments.

Edit
This error is occurring because the get() method is being used incorrectly. In Godot, get() is a method that takes one argument (a property name) and returns its value.

Looking at the context, it seems this is happening when checking for a piercing property. You're likely trying to do something like:

gdscript

Copy
var piercing = projectile.get("piercing", 0)
But the get() method doesn't take a default value parameter like Dictionary.get() does. Here's how to fix it:

gdscript

Copy
# Change this:
var piercing = projectile.get("piercing", 0)

# To something like this:
var piercing = 0  # Default value
if projectile.has("piercing"):
    piercing = projectile.piercing
Or, to make it cleaner, you can use the Godot get() method properly:

gdscript

Copy
var piercing = 0  # Default value
if projectile.has("piercing"):
    piercing = projectile.get("piercing")
This makes sure you're properly checking if the property exists before trying to access it.




Retry

I don't know if it was happening here maybe?:

    # Add visual
    var circle = ColorRect.new()
    circle.color = Color(1.0, 0.6, 0.1, 0.7)  # Orange for explosion
    var size = explosion_radius * 2
    circle.size = Vector2(size, size)
    circle.position = Vector2(-size/2, -size/2)  # Center the rect
    explosion.add_child(circle)

Edit
The error is likely occurring elsewhere, as that code looks fine. Let's track down where the invalid get() call could be happening.

The most likely culprit is in the piercing functionality or when checking projectile properties. There are a few places in your code where this might occur:

In the _on_projectile_hit function, you have this:
gdscript

Copy
var piercing = projectile.get("piercing", 0)
This should be changed to:
gdscript

Copy
var piercing = 0  # Default
if "piercing" in projectile:
    piercing = projectile.piercing
Similarly, in any place where you check for projectile properties like this:
gdscript

Copy
var someProperty = projectile.get("propertyName", defaultValue)
Change it to:
gdscript

Copy
var someProperty = defaultValue
if "propertyName" in projectile:
    someProperty = projectile.propertyName
The specific fix depends on which line is causing the error. Could you show me the full error message with line number? That would help pinpoint the exact location of the issue.
