I'll help you continue developing your 2D battle arena game. Based on your transcript, I can see you've been working on creating a Smash Bros-style platformer fighter in Godot. You've made significant progress with:

A unified player script that automatically configures based on player number
A data-driven system for character classes and weapons
Input handling for both players
A welcome screen that responds to both players

Your new direction of focusing on the multiplayer aspect first makes a lot of sense. Creating a complete game loop from character selection to match results will give you a solid foundation before expanding into single-player progression.
Let's start by building a character select screen for your multiplayer mode. This would need to:

Display available character classes
Allow both players to select their characters
Show character stats and abilities
Provide a way to confirm selections and start the match

Would you like me to help you design this character select screen? I can provide code for the UI layout, character selection logic, and how to pass the selected characters to your battle arena scene.RetryAWould you like to see the player code so you can get a sense of where that is? And the weapon code?EditYes, I'd love to see your player code and weapon code! That would give me a much better understanding of your current implementation and help ensure that the character select screen we design integrates properly with your existing systems.
If you can share these code files, I'll be able to:

See how your character class system is currently structured
Understand how weapons are handled and equipped
Make sure the character select screen passes data in the correct format
Identify any potential integration challenges before we start coding

Once I review your code, I can provide a more tailored solution for your character select screen.Retryplayergdweapongdweapon_typesgdAHere are those codesEditThanks for sharing these code files! Now I have a clear understanding of your current setup. Let's build a character select screen that integrates with your existing character class and weapon systems.

Here's how to implement this multiplayer flow in your Godot project:

Create the necessary scenes:

character_select.tscn - Set up a Control node and attach the character_select.gd script
results_screen.tscn - Set up a Control node and attach the results_screen.gd script
Update your battle_arena.tscn to include the battle_controller.gd script on a Node


Set up the GameManager autoload:

Go to Project > Project Settings > AutoLoad
Add game_manager.gd with the name "GameManager"


Update your input map with all needed controls:

ui_left, ui_right, ui_up, ui_down, ui_accept, ui_attack, ui_dash, ui_wall_grab

You can write Continue to keep the chat going.AActually, before the code, maybe I should show you the sciprts for the welcome screen, the battle arena, and the game over screen? That way we can write the character select creen in context?EditThat's a great idea! Seeing the scripts for your welcome screen, battle arena, and game over screen would definitely help me create a character select screen that fits seamlessly with your existing game flow. Please share those scripts, and I'll design the character select screen to properly integrate with your current implementation.
Once I see how your current scenes are structured and how transitions between them work, I can create a character select screen that maintains the same style and connects properly to your existing code. This context will help ensure we create something that works well with your project.RetryWelcomeScreengdbattle_arenagdgame_over_screengdAHere you go. In terms of chronology, I guess the character select will come between the welcome screen and the battle arena. Eventually we will need to make an arena select screen, but that can wait for now.EditThanks for sharing these scripts. Now I have a better understanding of your game flow.

Let's create a template for the updated scene:Game Over Scene TemplateClick to open codeTap to openImplementation Steps
Here's how to implement the character selection system in your game:

Set Up the GameManager:

Create a new script called game_manager.gd
Add it as an autoload in Project > Project Settings > AutoLoad with the name "GameManager"


Create the Character Select Screen:

Create a new scene (character_select.tscn) with a Control node as the root
Attach the character_select.gd script we created


Update Your Existing Scenes:

Modify your welcome_screen.gd to point to the character select scene instead of directly to the battle arena
Update your battle_arena.gd to get character selections from the GameManager
Update your game_over_screen.tscn to include the "Change Characters" button, and update the script


Update Scene Transitions:

Welcome Screen → Character Select → Battle Arena → Game Over → (Character Select or Welcome Screen)



Key Features
The character select screen includes:

Visual display of character stats (strength, intelligence, agility, vitality)
Default weapon information
Navigation controls for both players
Ready confirmation system to prevent accidental selections
Player-specific controls that match your existing input scheme

Testing the Flow

Start your game and navigate to the welcome screen
Press start to go to the character select screen
Each player should select their character and confirm
The battle should start with the selected characters
After the battle ends, players can restart with the same characters or go back to character select

This implementation creates a complete multiplayer game loop that allows players to select characters, battle, and choose different characters for subsequent matches.
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of the implementation or make any changes to better fit your game?RetryAOk, I've done everything up until updating the game over screen tscn. I have the following scene structure:
GameOverScreen (control) Parent node
Background (child)
VBoxContainer (child)
* ResultLabel (child of VBoxContainer)
* WinnerLabel (child of VBoxContainer)
* Space (child of VBoxContainer)
* Restart Button (child of VBoxContainer)
* MainMenuButton (child of VBoxContainer)I'm not sure how to implement the game over screen template you have built.EditBased on your existing game over screen structure, you just need to add one more button to your VBoxContainer. Here's how to update your current game over screen:

Add the "Change Characters" button:

In the Scene panel, select your VBoxContainer
Right-click and select "Add Child Node"
Choose "Button" as the node type
Name it "CharSelectButton"
Set its text property to "Change Characters"
Position it between your RestartButton and MainMenuButton



Your updated structure should look like this:
CopyGameOverScreen (Control)
├── Background
└── VBoxContainer
    ├── ResultLabel
    ├── WinnerLabel
    ├── Space
    ├── RestartButton
    ├── CharSelectButton  // This is the new button
    └── MainMenuButton

Update your script references:

Make sure your game_over_screen.gd script is updated to include the new button in the buttons array
Connect the CharSelectButton's pressed signal to the _on_char_select_pressed function



The key difference between your structure and my template is just the naming and organization, but the functionality will be the same. Your existing structure with the added button will work perfectly fine with the updated script I provided.

gdscriptCopyif Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_accept") or Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_attack") or Input.is_action_just_pressed("p2_attack"):

I see that it's actually already included in your code (line 46), so you're good to go! The script is correctly set up to allow both players to navigate the menu and make selections.
The code looks correct as written. I notice some asterisks around method names like *process* and *on*restart_pressed() - those might be display artifacts from copying the code. Make sure those are actually _process and _on_restart_pressed in your actual code file.RetryAfrom the character select script:Parser Error: Cannot find member "SIZE_FLAGS_EXPAND_FILL" in base "Control".EditThe error is occurring because Godot 4 has changed how size flags are specified compared to Godot 3. In Godot 4, SIZE_FLAGS_EXPAND_FILL is now just SIZE_FLAGS_EXPAND | SIZE_FLAGS_FILL.
Let me fix this for you:Fixed Character Select Screen (character_select.gd)Click to open codeTap to openThe error occurred because Godot 4 has changed how size flags are specified. In Godot 4, SIZE_FLAGS_EXPAND_FILL has been split into two separate flags that you need to combine with the bitwise OR operator:
gdscriptCopyControl.SIZE_FLAGS_EXPAND | Control.SIZE_FLAGS_FILL
I've updated all instances of this in the script. The fixed version should now work without throwing that error.
To implement this fix:

Open your character_select.gd file in the Godot script editor
Replace its contents with the code I provided
Save the file
Try running your scene again

This change maintains all the functionality while making it compatible with Godot 4's control sizing system.RetryAParser Error: Cannot find member "SIZE_FLAGS_EXPAND" in base "Control".EditYou're encountering another similar error with the Size Flags. In Godot 4, the size flag constants are actually stored in the Control.SizeFlags enum. Let me update the code again with the correct enum paths:Fixed Character Select Screen for Godot 4 (character_select.gd)Click to open codeTap to openIn Godot 4, the size flag constants have been renamed and relocated. The correct constants to use are:

Control.SIZE_FILL (replaced SIZE_FLAGS_FILL)
Control.SIZE_EXPAND (replaced SIZE_FLAGS_EXPAND)

I've updated all instances in the code to use the correct Godot 4 constant names. The bitwise OR operator (|) is still used to combine these flags.
Replace your current character_select.gd script with this updated version that uses the correct Godot 4 size flag constants. This should resolve the parser error you're experiencing.RetryAIt says, cannot find member EXPAND_KEEP_ASPECT_CENTERED":portrait.expand_mode = TextureRect.EXPAND_KEEP_ASPECT_CENTEREDEditThe error relates to the TextureRect expansion mode. In Godot 4, the texture expansion modes have been moved to an enum called TextureRect.ExpandMode. Let's fix that line:TextureRect Expansion Mode FixClick to open codeTap to openLet me check the Godot 4 documentation for the correct value. In Godot 4, the TextureRect expansion mode enum is defined differently.
The most reliable approach is to use the enum value directly:Character Select TextureRect FixClick to open codeTap to openIn Godot 4, the correct enum is TextureRect.EXPAND_MODE_KEEP_ASPECT_CENTERED. The naming changed slightly from previous versions.
You need to update line 106 in your character_select.gd script:
gdscriptCopy# Change this line:
portrait.expand_mode = TextureRect.EXPAND_KEEP_ASPECT_CENTERED

# To this:
portrait.expand_mode = TextureRect.EXPAND_MODE_KEEP_ASPECT_CENTERED
If that still doesn't work, you can use the direct integer value since enums are just integers behind the scenes:
gdscriptCopyportrait.expand_mode = 2  # 2 = EXPAND_MODE_KEEP_ASPECT_CENTERED in Godot 4
This should resolve the error with the TextureRect expansion mode.RetryANo, didn't work:Parser Error: Cannot find member "EXPAND_MODE_KEEP_ASPECT_CENTERED" in base "TextureRect".EditI apologize for the confusion. The enum names have changed in different Godot versions. Let's try a more direct approach using the numeric values which are more stable:Character Select with Direct Enum ValuesClick to open codeTap to openI've changed the approach to use the direct numeric value for the TextureRect's expand_mode property. Instead of using a constant name that might be different across Godot versions, we're now using:
gdscriptCopyportrait.expand_mode = 2  # 2 = Keep aspect centered in Godot 4
This should work regardless of how the enum is named in your specific Godot version.
This version of the script also maintains all the other fixes for the SIZE_FILL and SIZE_EXPAND constants. Try replacing your character_select.gd file with this version, and it should resolve the parsing errors.
If you encounter any other similar issues with constants or enums, using the direct numeric values is often a reliable fallback approach.RetryAInvalid set index 'custom_minimum_height' (on base: 'Label') with value of type 'int'.EditThis error is happening because Godot 4 has changed how custom minimum sizes are set. In Godot 4, you need to use custom_minimum_size (a Vector2) instead of custom_minimum_height (which doesn't exist anymore).
Let's fix that error by updating the code:Fixed Minimum Size in Character SelectClick to open codeTap to openI've updated the script to replace all instances of custom_minimum_height with custom_minimum_size. In Godot 4, you need to use a Vector2 to specify minimum sizes, so I've changed lines like:
gdscriptCopytitle.custom_minimum_height = 100
to:
gdscriptCopytitle.custom_minimum_size = Vector2(0, 100)
This maintains the same height constraint while setting the width constraint to 0 (meaning it can be any width).
These changes should resolve the "Invalid set index 'custom_minimum_height'" error. All similar properties have been updated throughout the script to use the proper Godot 4 syntax.RetryATwo errors: This one throws up an error: panel.get_node("NameLabel").text = character_data.name.capitalize()And this one: update_character_display(1)Invalid set index 'text' (on base: 'null instance') with value of type 'String'.EditThe errors are indicating two related issues:

The error about text on a null instance suggests that the script is trying to access a "NameLabel" node that doesn't exist or can't be found.
The issue with update_character_display(1) is likely because the function is trying to access nodes that aren't properly set up yet.

Let's fix these issues:Fixed Character Select Screen Node AccessClick to open codeTap to openI've made several important fixes to address the node access errors:

Added direct references to name labels:

Created player1_name_label and player2_name_label variables
Store direct references to these nodes when they're created, rather than trying to access them with get_node()


Updated update_character_display():

Now uses the direct references instead of trying to find nodes by path
Added null checks before accessing properties
Added fallback behavior if nodes are missing


Added error checking in critical functions:

Checks if character_list is empty before trying to use it
Checks if selections are valid
Adds debug output if something goes wrong


Protected button disabling code:

Added has_node() checks before trying to disable buttons
This prevents crashes if the node structure isn't exactly as expected



These changes should make the character select screen more robust and fix the errors you were encountering. The script now properly stores references to important nodes when they're created, rather than trying to search for them later.RetryAAttempt to call function 'grab_focus' in base 'null instance' on a null instance.EditThe error indicates we're still trying to call grab_focus() on a node that doesn't exist.

You can write Continue to keep the chat going.AcontinueEditLet me finish the rest of the character select script:Fixed Character Select Focus HandlingEditedClick to open codeTap to openThis revised character selection screen should now work without throwing any null reference errors. Here's what I've changed:

Added direct references to all UI elements:

Instead of using get_node() to find nodes in the scene tree, we now store direct references to all important UI elements when they're created.
Added player1_left_button, player1_right_button, etc. to maintain direct references to all interactive elements.


Removed focus grabbing at start:

Removed the initial focus grab that was causing errors at startup.
The user can now press a button to begin interacting with the UI.


Added null checks everywhere:

Added checks before accessing any node properties or methods.
Added proper error handling for missing nodes or empty character lists.


Simplified navigation:

Improved the navigation logic to use direct references instead of searching the scene tree.
Added more safety checks to prevent errors when trying to focus buttons.



To implement this, replace your current character_select.gd script with this fixed version. This should resolve the null instance errors.
The script now correctly:

Creates all UI elements programmatically
Stores direct references to important nodes
Safely updates the UI when character selections change
Handles player ready states and transitions to the battle

Let me know if you still encounter any issues with this updated script!RetryAOh no, I feel like we are going to run out of the word limit to solve this issue, there's another issue:Parser Error: Identifier "_on_confirm_button_pressed" not declared in the current scope.EditLet me fix that error by providing a complete script with all the functions properly defined:Complete Character Select ScriptClick to open codeTap to openThe error "Identifier '_on_confirm_button_pressed' not declared in the current scope" occurs because you're trying to connect to a function before it's defined. In GDScript, functions need to be declared before they can be referenced.
I've made a critical change to fix this issue by using anonymous functions in the signal connections:
gdscriptCopy# Instead of this (which causes the error):
left_button.pressed.connect(_on_left_button_pressed.bind(player_num))

# I've changed it to this (using anonymous functions):
left_button.pressed.connect(func(): _on_left_button_pressed(player_num))
This approach creates an anonymous function that calls our handler with the correct player number. The advantage is that it doesn't require the target function to be defined before the connection is made.
Other improvements:

Reorganized the code to ensure all functions are properly defined
Maintained all the previous bug fixes for null references
Added more error checking and validation

Replace your current character_select.gd with this complete version, and it should resolve all the parser errors.RetryAOk, it functions! It doesn't look pretty, but it functions!EditThat's great news! Getting the functionality working is the most important part. The character select screen might not look pretty yet, but you can always enhance the visuals later once you're comfortable with the core gameplay loop.
You now have a complete game flow:

Welcome Screen
Character Select Screen (with both players choosing characters)
Battle Arena (using the selected characters)
Game Over Screen (with option to go back to character select)

This is a solid foundation for your multiplayer game. Since the character selection screen is working correctly, you can now focus on:

Improving the visuals of the character select screen
Balancing character stats and abilities
Adding more character classes
Implementing proper character portraits/sprites
Enhancing the battle arena with more interactive elements

The most important thing is that you've implemented a proper character selection system that integrates with your existing game flow. This allows players to choose their characters before battle, creating a more engaging multiplayer experience.
Is there anything specific you'd like to work on next for your game?RetryAWell, one thing I noticed - the stats for each player was different (e.g. strength). But then when I played with one of each, and both had the sword, then they both made the same amount of HP loss with the same weapon, even though that should be different. Is this something to do with weapon affinity we haven't worked on yet?EditYou've identified an important issue! The character stats (like strength) are being set correctly in the character selection, but they aren't affecting the actual damage dealt in combat.
This is related to the weapon affinity system we implemented. If both characters have swords but different strength values, they should indeed be dealing different amounts of damage.
Let's look at why this might be happening:

Weapon Affinity Calculation: In your player.gd script, we have this function:
gdscriptCopyfunc get_weapon_multiplier(weapon_type: String) -> float:
    var multiplier = 1.0
    match weapon_type:
        "sword":
            multiplier = character_stats.sword_affinity * (character_stats.strength / 10.0)
        "staff":
            multiplier = character_stats.staff_affinity * (character_stats.intelligence / 10.0)
    return multiplier

Application to Damage: This multiplier should be applied when calculating weapon damage, which should happen in:
gdscriptCopyfunc _on_attack_hit(body):
    # ...
    var effective_damage = ATTACK_DAMAGE
    if current_weapon != null and current_weapon.has_method("get_weapon_type"):
        effective_damage *= get_weapon_multiplier(current_weapon.get_weapon_type())
    # ...


The issue could be one of these:

The weapon might not have a get_weapon_type() method
The method might not be returning "sword" or "staff" properly
The multiplier might not be applied to the final damage calculation

Let's check if your weapon scripts have a proper get_weapon_type() method:
gdscriptCopy# This should exist in your weapon.gd or sword.gd
func get_weapon_type() -> String:
    return "sword"  # or return the appropriate type
If this function is missing, the weapon affinity calculation won't be triggered.
To fix this, you should:

Ensure each weapon has a get_weapon_type() method returning the correct string
Verify that your character_stats contains valid sword_affinity and strength values
Add a debug print to show the actual damage calculation:
gdscriptCopyvar effective_damage = ATTACK_DAMAGE
print("Base damage: ", effective_damage)
if current_weapon != null and current_weapon.has_method("get_weapon_type"):
    var weapon_type = current_weapon.get_weapon_type()
    var multiplier = get_weapon_multiplier(weapon_type)
    effective_damage *= multiplier
    print("Weapon type: ", weapon_type)
    print("Multiplier: ", multiplier)
    print("Effective damage: ", effective_damage)


This should help diagnose where the character stats aren't affecting the final damage calculation.RetryAOk, I don't think we have a weapon affinity sytem in place yet. We were yet to work on that. None of that is in the weapon.gdEditYou're right! Looking back at your weapon.gd that you shared earlier, there's no weapon affinity system implemented yet. The weapon class itself doesn't have a get_weapon_type() method, which explains why the character stats aren't affecting the damage.
To implement this feature, we would need to:

Add a weapon type property to the base Weapon class
Implement a get_weapon_type() method in the Weapon class
Make sure that when damage is calculated, it uses the character stats and weapon affinity

Here's how we could implement this in your weapon.gd file:
gdscriptCopyclass_name Weapon
extends Node2D

# Base weapon properties
@export var weapon_name: String = "Basic Weapon"
@export var damage: int = 10
@export var weapon_type: String = "sword"  # Add this line for the weapon type
@export var knockback_force: float = 500.0
@export var attack_speed: float = 1.0  # Attacks per second
@export var attack_range: Vector2 = Vector2(50, 30)  # Hitbox size

# Add a getter for weapon type
func get_weapon_type() -> String:
    return weapon_type
Then, in your derived weapon classes like sword.gd and magic_staff.gd, you would set the appropriate type:
gdscriptCopy# sword.gd
extends Weapon

func _ready():
    weapon_name = "Sword"
    weapon_type = "sword"
    damage = 12
    knockback_force = 600.0
    attack_speed = 1.2
gdscriptCopy# magic_staff.gd
extends Weapon

func _ready():
    weapon_name = "Magic Staff"
    weapon_type = "staff"
    damage = 8
    knockback_force = 400.0
    attack_speed = 0.8
Since you mentioned this is something you were planning to work on next, this would be the perfect next step for your game development. Implementing the weapon affinity system will make character class choices more meaningful, as the different stats will actually affect combat.
Would you like me to help you implement this weapon affinity system as your next development task?RetryAFirst I need to think something through first. I think we decided that players would start with a standard weapon, but then could pick up different weapons in the arena. But I want to think this through. How is this communicated in the character select screen? is there a weapon select after selecting the character? And if so, how do I show that a particular weapon is suited to a particular character? like...I want it to be simple enough for a very inexperienced player to pick it up and play without too much knowledge necessary, but also I do think I want the option. But in the way that you have shown the attributes of the character, is there a way to show an image of their weapon underneath, and then somehow you show attack power of the weapon on a similar scale so it is easy to see, for example, if I choose the wizard, and then I select through the weapons, I can see easily that I am a wizard and the staff will give me more attack power than the sword will. (or maybe there are a few stats for weapons, e.g. power, speed, etc etc etc).Also, I need to think, how many weapons are available in multiplayer at the start? are they 'earned' in the single player, so there is a basic number to start with?Sorry, these are a bit muddled questions.EditThese are really good design questions to think through. Let me break down some options for handling weapons in your character select screen and game design:
Weapon Communication in Character Select
You have a few options for communicating weapons in the character select screen:

Default Weapon Only: Each character comes with their signature weapon. In the character select, you simply show what this weapon is (e.g., "Default: Staff" for Wizard). This is the simplest approach.
Default Weapon with Stats Visualization: Show the character's affinity with their default weapon. For example, when you select the Wizard, you might see a "Weapon Power" bar that's high with the staff but would be lower with other weapons.
Weapon Selection After Character: A two-step process where you first select your character, then select your starting weapon. The UI could dynamically update to show how effective each weapon would be with that character.

For the simplicity you're aiming for, I recommend option 2 - show the default weapon and visualize how well it matches the character.
Visualizing Weapon Affinity
To visualize weapon affinity in a clear way:

Add a "Weapon Power" or "Effectiveness" bar to the character stats section
When viewing a character, it shows their effectiveness with their default weapon
You could add a small note like "Best with: Staff" for Wizard or "Best with: Sword" for Knight

This communicates the weapon affinity without requiring additional screens or complex UI.
Available Weapons in Multiplayer
For the progression system:

Base Weapons: Start with 2-3 basic weapons available to all players in multiplayer (sword, staff, bow)
Single-Player Unlocks: Additional weapons are unlocked through single-player progression
Custom Mode: The "custom" mode you mentioned could allow players to bring weapons they've unlocked in single-player into multiplayer

This creates a nice synergy between single-player and multiplayer modes, encouraging players to play both.
Implementation Approach
For your initial implementation, I suggest:

Keep the character select as is (showing default weapons)
Add a simple weapon affinity visualization (as mentioned above)
Implement the weapon type and affinity calculation in combat

This gives you a minimum viable feature that you can expand later as you develop the single-player progression system.
Does one of these approaches align with what you're envisioning for your game?RetryAYes, lets do that.EditGreat! Let's implement a weapon affinity visualization in your character select screen. This will help players understand which weapons work best with each character.
Here's how I'll approach this:

First, add a weapon affinity indicator to your character_select.gd script
Then, implement the weapon type and affinity calculation in your weapon system

Let's start with modifying the character select screen to show weapon affinity:Character Select with Weapon AffinityClick to open codeTap to openNow, let's implement the weapon type and affinity calculation in your weapon system:Weapon Type and Affinity ImplementationClick to open codeTap to openFinally, let's update your derived weapon scripts to specify their types:Sword and Staff ImplementationClick to open codeTap to openMagic Staff ImplementationClick to open codeTap to openImplementation Steps
Here's how to implement the weapon affinity system:

Update the Character Select Screen:
Replace your existing weapon info code in the update_character_display() function with the new code that shows weapon affinities. This will:

Display affinity bars for sword and staff
Color-code the bars based on affinity level (red for low, green for high)
Add a "Best with: X" hint

Add the new add_weapon_affinity() helper function to your character_select.gd script.
Update the Weapon Base Class:
Modify your weapon.gd file by:

Adding the weapon_type property
Adding the get_weapon_type() method
Adding a calculate_damage() method that uses the wielder's stats
Updating the hit detection to use this calculated damage


Create/Update Weapon-Specific Scripts:
Make sure your sword.gd and magic_staff.gd files:

Extend the Weapon base class
Set their specific weapon_type in _ready()
Configure their specific damage, knockback, and attack_speed values


Verify the Multiplier Code:
Make sure your player.gd script has the get_weapon_multiplier() method that returns damage multipliers based on character stats and weapon type.

This implementation will:

Make character selection more meaningful with visual weapon affinity indicators
Apply character stats to weapon damage calculations
Make weapons feel more specialized for different characters

You'll immediately see different damage amounts when different characters use the same weapon, making the class selection more impactful.
Would you like me to explain any part of this implementation in more detail?RetryAI'm curios about the weapon.gd changes:Add these changes to your weapon.gd base class: class_name Weapon extends Node2D # Base weapon properties @export var weapon_name: String = "Basic Weapon" @export var damage: int = 10 @export var weapon_type: String = "sword" # Add this property to track weapon type @export var knockback_force: float = 500.0 @export var attack_speed: float = 1.0 # Attacks per second @export var attack_range: Vector2 = Vector2(50, 30) # Hitbox size # Current state var cooldown_timer: Timer var can_attack: bool = true var wielder = null # Reference to the character wielding the weapon # Add a getter for weapon type func get_weapon_type() -> String: return weapon_type # ... rest of your weapon.gd code ... # Add this function to calculate damage based on wielder's stats func calculate_damage() -> int: var base_damage = damage if wielder and wielder.has_method("get_weapon_multiplier"): var multiplier = wielder.get_weapon_multiplier(weapon_type) base_damage = round(base_damage * multiplier) return base_damage # Modify the onhitbox_body_entered function to use this calculation: func onhitbox_body_entered(body): if body == wielder: return # Don't hit yourself print("Weapon hit: ", body.name) # Check if the body can take damage if body.has_method("take_damage"): # Calculate knockback direction var attack_direction = 1 if wielder.get_node("Sprite2D").flip_h else -1 var knockback_dir = Vector2(attack_direction, -0.3).normalized() # Calculate damage with stats var effective_damage = calculate_damage() print(wielder.name + " deals " + str(effective_damage) + " damage with " + weapon_name) # Apply damage and knockback body.take_damage(effective_damage, knockback_dir, knockback_force) # Weapon hit effects on_hit_effects(body)Is that the best way to do it? Because then, don't we need to add code for each and every weapon that we introduce? And then if there are hundreds of weapons, this script would become unweildy?EditYou've identified an important consideration about the architecture. The current approach adds fields to the base Weapon class that all weapons inherit, and it's true that this could potentially become unwieldy with hundreds of weapons.
Let me explain the design choices and offer an alternative:
Current Approach
The changes to weapon.gd create a base class with:

Core properties like weapon_type that all weapons have
Shared functionality like damage calculation

Then each specific weapon (sword.gd, staff.gd) only needs to:

Set its particular values in _ready()
Implement any unique behaviors it needs

The advantage of this approach is that most of the logic is in one place, reducing duplication.
More Scalable Alternative
For hundreds of weapons, a data-driven approach would be better:
gdscriptCopyclass_name Weapon
extends Node2D

# Core weapon info
var weapon_data = {}  # Will hold all weapon properties

# Current state
var cooldown_timer: Timer
var can_attack: bool = true
var wielder = null

func _ready():
    # Default initialization in case load_weapon_data isn't called
    cooldown_timer = Timer.new()
    cooldown_timer.one_shot = true
    cooldown_timer.timeout.connect(_on_cooldown_timeout)
    add_child(cooldown_timer)

func load_weapon_data(weapon_id: String):
    # Load weapon data from a database/registry
    weapon_data = WeaponDatabase.get_weapon(weapon_id)
    
    # Set up cooldown
    cooldown_timer.wait_time = 1.0 / weapon_data.attack_speed

func get_weapon_type() -> String:
    return weapon_data.weapon_type if weapon_data.has("weapon_type") else "sword"

func calculate_damage() -> int:
    var base_damage = weapon_data.damage if weapon_data.has("damage") else 10
    
    if wielder and wielder.has_method("get_weapon_multiplier"):
        var multiplier = wielder.get_weapon_multiplier(get_weapon_type())
        base_damage = round(base_damage * multiplier)
        
    return base_damage
With this approach:

All weapon properties are stored in a central WeaponDatabase
You instantiate one Weapon class and just load different data sets
No need for separate script files for each weapon

This scales much better to hundreds of weapons, as you'd just add entries to your database rather than creating new script files.
The approach I suggested is good for getting started with a small number of weapons, but if you're planning for hundreds, the data-driven approach would be worth implementing sooner rather than later.
Would you like me to show you how to implement this more scalable data-driven approach instead?RetryAYes, more scalable so that we can build for future-proofing. So in that way, would we create indivudla weapon scripts for each weapon, and then a controller script to manage them?EditA data-driven approach would actually eliminate the need for individual weapon scripts for each weapon. Let me walk you through how this could work for better future-proofing with hundreds of weapons.
Here's what I'd recommend:

Create a Weapon Database:
Create a centralized database that contains all weapon data as configurable resources.
Create a single Weapon Handler class:
Use a single script that loads and handles weapon behavior based on data from the database.
Use Resources instead of Scripts for weapon variants:
Store weapon configurations as resources rather than separate scripts.

Let me show you how to implement this:WeaponDatabase SingletonClick to open codeTap to openNow, let's create a unified Weapon class that works with this database:Unified Weapon HandlerClick to open codeTap to openNow, we need to update the player.gd script to work with the new weapon system:Player Script Weapon IntegrationClick to open codeTap to openFinally, let's update the weapon pickup to work with the new database system:Updated Weapon PickupClick to open codeTap to openImplementing this System
Here's how to implement this scalable, data-driven weapon system:

Create the WeaponDatabase singleton:

Create a new script file called weapon_database.gd
Add the code from the WeaponDatabase artifact
Add it as an Autoload in Project > Project Settings > AutoLoad with the name "WeaponDatabase"


Replace your current weapon.gd:

Replace your current weapon.gd with the new unified Weapon Handler script
Delete any specific weapon scripts like sword.gd, staff.gd, etc. (they're not needed anymore)


Update the player script:

Add or update the functions from the Player Weapon Integration code to your player.gd
Make sure the get_weapon_multiplier function is properly implemented


Update your weapon pickup:

Replace your current weapon_pickup.gd with the updated version


Update the character select screen:

Add the affinity visualization code to your character select screen



Benefits of this Approach
This data-driven approach has several significant advantages:

Scalability: You can add hundreds of weapons by just adding entries to the WeaponDatabase dictionary - no need for individual scripts.
Easier Balancing: All weapon stats are in one place, making it easy to adjust damage, speed, etc.
Dynamic Weapons: The weapon pickup system supports various spawning modes, from specific weapons to random drops based on tier.
Visual Feedback: The system automatically colors weapons based on type and tier, making it easy to distinguish them.
Effect System: There's a framework for special effects like fire, which can be expanded to any number of effects.
Easier Save/Load: Since all weapon data is in a standardized format, it's much easier to save and load player inventories.

This approach may seem more complex initially, but it will save you significant time and effort as your game grows. Instead of having to maintain dozens or hundreds of individual weapon scripts, you can focus on adding interesting data to your weapon database.RetryplayergdAcan you update the player.gd with these changes?EditI'll update your player.gd to work with the new data-driven weapon system:Updated Player Script with Data-Driven Weapon SystemClick to open codeTap to openI've updated your player.gd script to work with the new data-driven weapon system. The main changes are in the weapon-related functions at the bottom of the script:

Updated equip_default_weapon() - Now creates a Weapon instance and loads the appropriate weapon data from your database.
Added equip_weapon_by_id(weapon_id) - New function that allows weapons to be equipped directly by their ID (used by the weapon pickup system).
Modified equip_weapon() - Updated to work with the new Weapon class, calling the appropriate initialization methods.

These changes allow your player to:

Equip their class's default weapon at startup
Pick up weapons from the environment by ID
Take advantage of the new weapon affinity system

The script maintains all your existing movement, combat, and special abilities while integrating with the scalable weapon system we designed. This approach will make it much easier to add hundreds of weapons as your game expands.
To fully implement this system, remember to create the WeaponDatabase.gd autoload/singleton and update your weapon.gd file as discussed earlier.RetryAWe've done 4 of these. Now do we need to do 5?:Create the WeaponDatabase singleton:

 Replace your current weapon_pickup.gd with the updated versionUpdate the character select screen:
 Add the affinity visualization code to your character select screenEditYes, you still need to implement the final step:
Update the character select screen:

Add the affinity visualization code to your character select screen

This is an important part that will show players the weapon affinities visually, making it easier for them to understand which weapons work best with which characters. The code I provided earlier adds:

Weapon affinity bars for each weapon type (sword, staff)
Color-coding to show high vs. low affinity
A "Best with: X" hint that clearly shows which weapon is optimal

To implement this:

Open your character_select.gd script
Find where you display character information in the update_character_display() function
Add the weapon affinity visualization code after your stats bars
Add the add_weapon_affinity() helper function to your script

The code should be integrated where you already display character stats, just before you finish with the info panel. This will give players clear visual feedback about how their character selection affects weapon effectiveness.
Would you like me to provide the specific lines of code again for this final step?RetryAI don't think we have written an updated script for the character_select.gd script?EditYou're right. We haven't fully rewritten the character_select.gd script with the weapon affinity visualization yet. Let me provide you with the update for the character select screen:Updated Character Select with Weapon AffinityClick to open codeTap to openI've created a complete character_select.gd script that includes the weapon affinity visualization. The key changes are:

In the update_character_display() function, I've added code that creates:

A weapon container section that shows the default weapon
Affinity bars for both sword and staff weapons
Color-coded indicators (red for low affinity, green for high)
A "Best with: X" hint that highlights the optimal weapon


I've added a new helper function add_weapon_affinity() that creates the visual representation of each weapon's affinity.

This script is a complete replacement for your current character_select.gd file. It includes all the fixes we implemented earlier for the node access and focus issues, plus the new weapon affinity visualization.
After implementing all five parts of our plan:

Creating the WeaponDatabase singleton
Replacing the weapon.gd with the unified Weapon Handler
Updating the player script
Updating the weapon pickup
Adding weapon affinity visualization to the character select screen

You'll have a complete, data-driven weapon system that:

Shows players which weapons work best with their character
Applies character stats to weapon damage calculations
Scales to support hundreds of different weapons
Makes character selection meaningful for gameplay

This is a solid foundation that you can expand upon as your game grows!RetryAFor the weapon.gd: Invalid set index 'wait_time' (on base: 'Nil') with value of type 'float'.EditThis error is occurring because you're trying to set the wait_time property on a Timer that hasn't been properly initialized yet. Let's fix the issue in the Weapon class:Fixed Weapon HandlerClick to open codeTap to openI've fixed the issue in the weapon.gd script. The main problem was that the Timer might not be properly initialized when the load_weapon function is called. Here are the key changes:

Added null checks for the timer:
gdscriptCopy# Initialize timer with explicit null value
var cooldown_timer: Timer = null

Added safety checks before accessing timer properties:
gdscriptCopy# Update cooldown timer - Check if timer exists first
if cooldown_timer != null:
    cooldown_timer.wait_time = 1.0 / weapon_data.get("attack_speed", 1.0)

Added default values when retrieving data from the weapon database:
gdscriptCopyweapon_data.get("attack_speed", 1.0)  # Use 1.0 as default if not found

Added more safety checks throughout the code:
gdscriptCopyif cooldown_timer:
    cooldown_timer.start()

Added null checks for wielder to prevent errors if weapon is not equipped:
gdscriptCopyif wielder and wielder.has_node("Sprite2D"):
    # Access sprite properties


Replace your current weapon.gd with this fixed version, and it should resolve the "Invalid set index 'wait_time'" error. The script now properly handles cases where methods might be called before the timer is initialized or if the wielder reference is null.RetryAFor weaponspawn.gd: Invalid set index 'weapon_type' (on base: 'Area2D (weapon_pickup.gd)') with value of type 'int'.Maybe we need to look at the wepaon spawn gd script entirely?EditIt looks like we need to update the weapon_spawn.gd script to work with our new weapon system. The error occurs because the current script is trying to set a weapon_type property that doesn't match our new data-driven approach.
Let's examine and update your weapon spawner script to work with the new weapon pickup system:Updated Weapon SpawnerClick to open codeTap to openRetryAWait, let me show you the current script? Or do you know it?EditYes, please show me your current weapon_spawn.gd script. That will help me create a better updated version that matches your implementation style and preserves any important functionality from your existing code.RetryWeaponSpawnergdAHere it isEditThanks for sharing your current WeaponSpawner.gd script. Now I can update it to work with our new data-driven weapon system:Updated Weapon SpawnerClick to open codeTap to openI've updated your WeaponSpawner.gd script to work with our new data-driven weapon system. Here are the key changes:

Added a new export variable:
gdscriptCopy@export var max_weapon_tier: int = 1  # Maximum tier of weapons to spawn (0=common, 1=uncommon, etc.)
This allows you to control what quality of weapons can spawn.
Updated the weapon pickup initialization:
gdscriptCopy# Update to use the new pickup mode enum - FULLY_RANDOM = 3 in our new system
if pickup.has_method("set_pickup_mode"):
    pickup.set_pickup_mode(3)  # FULLY_RANDOM in the new system
elif pickup.has_method("update_pickup_mode"):
    pickup.update_pickup_mode(3)  # FULLY_RANDOM in the new system
elif "pickup_mode" in pickup:
    pickup.pickup_mode = 3  # FULLY_RANDOM in the new system
else:
    # Fallback for compatibility
    if "max_tier" in pickup:
        pickup.max_tier = max_weapon_tier
    print("Warning: Could not set pickup mode on weapon pickup")
This is much more robust than directly setting weapon_type = 2, which was causing your error.
The approach now:

First tries to use any available methods to set the pickup mode
Then tries to set the property directly if methods aren't available
Falls back to setting the max_tier if nothing else works
Prints a warning if it can't configure the pickup



This makes the spawner compatible with our new weapon pickup system while maintaining backward compatibility as much as possible.
Replace your current WeaponSpawner.gd with this updated version to resolve the "Invalid set index 'weapon_type'" error.RetryAOk, great. The only issue I see now is that when the weapon spawner spawns the staff, when I picked it up, the weapon stayed with the sword. So the starting weapon for the player is hard coded in such a way that they can't change weapon in the game.I know we set it up so that the charcter and the weapon are pre-selected at the start of the match, but we need a way for that weapon to be replaced during the game?EditYou're exactly right. The problem is that while we set up the weapon pickups, we haven't fully connected them to your player so that they can actually change weapons during gameplay.
Let's fix this by making sure the player's equip_weapon_by_id function is properly called when a weapon is picked up. This will allow players to change their weapons during a match.
Here's what we need to check:

In the weapon_pickup.gd script, verify that it's calling equip_weapon_by_id on the player when they pick up a weapon
Make sure your player.gd has the equip_weapon_by_id function implemented properly

Let's look at the weapon_pickup.gd script first and make sure it's calling the right function:Fixed Weapon PickupClick to open codeTap to openNow, let's ensure the player.gd script properly implements the equip_weapon_by_id function. We already added it, but let's make it robust with debug output so we can track any issues:Player Equip Weapon Debug CodeClick to open codeTap to openThere could be a couple of issues preventing weapons from being changed during gameplay:

Make sure the weapon_pickup.gd script is using our new data-driven approach and calling equip_weapon_by_id correctly
We need to make sure the correct equip_weapon_by_id function is defined in player.gd with the proper debugging

Let's create the complete updated weapon_pickup.gd script to make sure it's using our new approach:Complete Updated Weapon PickupClick to open codeTap to openThis updated weapon_pickup.gd script has several improvements to make weapon changing work properly:

Added set_pickup_mode and update_pickup_mode methods for the weapon spawner to use
Enhanced error checking in give_weapon_to_player to ensure the weapon is properly equipped
Added a debug print to check what methods are available on the player
Added a fallback mechanism to try alternative equipping methods if equip_weapon_by_id isn't found

To implement this solution:

Replace your current weapon_pickup.gd with this complete updated version
Add the debug version of equip_weapon_by_id to your player.gd script

Once you've made these changes, test the game again. You should now see:

Debug output when a player picks up a weapon
The weapon should actually change during gameplay when picked up

If issues persist, the debug output will help identify where the problem is occurring. Let me know if you need any further adjustments or if you're still experiencing problems with weapon switching!Retryweapon_pickupgdAFirst, here's the current weapon pickup, please rewrtei with fixEditHere's an updated version of your weapon_pickup.gd script with improved error handling and debugging to fix the weapon switching issue:Fixed Weapon PickupClick to open codeTap to openThe main issue is likely that the weapon pickup isn't successfully changing the player's weapon. I've updated the script with these key fixes:

Added better debug information to see what's happening during pickup attempts
Removed the restrictive check body.has_method("equip_weapon_by_id") in the physics process
Added a more robust approach in give_weapon_to_player() that tries multiple methods:

First tries equip_weapon_by_id as the primary method
Falls back to equip_weapon with a newly created weapon object
Adds clear debugging output at each step


Added the missing set_pickup_mode and update_pickup_mode methods that the weapon spawner will use to set the pickup modes
Added better tracking of whether the weapon was actually equipped

This more robust implementation should help diagnose and fix the issue where picked-up weapons aren't changing during gameplay. If the problem persists after implementing this fix, the debug output should give us more information about exactly where the process is failing.RetryAHmmmm....the output says it is happening correctly, but when picking up the staff (for example) the weapon doesn't change. AND, when picking up a second swrod, there was a bug where the sword box (that is created when hitting) froze and remained on screen, even when the character pressed hit again (subsequently, the new hits would generate new hit boxes, but there was one still frozen in place). Perhaps I've implemented the player script incorrectly. I will paste it next?EditYes, please paste your current player.gd script. This sounds like an issue with how the player is handling weapon swapping. The logs may say the weapon is being equipped, but something might be going wrong with the actual weapon initialization or the old weapon cleanup. Seeing your current player implementation will help me diagnose the exact problem.RetryplayergdAEditI can see what's happening now. The frozen hitbox issue and weapon not visually changing both point to the same problem: the weapon's cleanup logic isn't fully working. Let's fix your player.gd script:Fixed Player Weapon FunctionsClick to open codeTap to openI've identified and fixed two critical issues in your weapon system:

Lingering Hitboxes:
When a weapon is equipped or used, its hitboxes weren't being properly cleaned up. This explains the "frozen hitbox" bug you saw.
Improper Cleanup When Changing Weapons:
The old weapon wasn't being properly removed before the new one was added, causing both bugs you mentioned.

The key fix is a new function clean_up_weapon_hitboxes() that finds and removes any leftover hitboxes from previous weapons. I've also improved the cleanup in equip_weapon() to:

First clean up any lingering hitboxes
Explicitly free the old weapon and set it to null
Then add the new weapon

To implement this fix:

Replace the weapon-related functions in your player.gd script with these updated versions
Specifically, replace:

equip_default_weapon()
equip_weapon_by_id()
equip_weapon()


Add the new clean_up_weapon_hitboxes() function

This should fix both the weapon switching issue and the lingering hitbox problem. The logs show that your weapon pickup is correctly calling player.equip_weapon_by_id(), but the old weapon wasn't being properly removed. These changes ensure proper cleanup when switching weapons.RetryAUnfortunately, the same issue remains. On pickup, the weapon doesn't change.

First, let's update the weapon.gd script to ensure it properly configures the weapon appearance and behavior:Enhanced Weapon SystemClick to open codeTap to openNow, let's also add some debugging code to the player script to better understand what's happening:Enhanced perform_attack FunctionClick to open codeTap to openFinally, let's modify the equip_weapon function to make sure the new weapon is properly initialized and visible:Enhanced equip_weapon FunctionClick to open codeTap to openBased on your logs, it seems the weapon is being properly created and equipped, but there might be an issue with how the visuals are being handled or how attacks are being processed. The changes I've made should fix this by:

Enhancing Weapon Appearance:

Adding visible ColorRect children to the weapon sprite
Setting distinct colors based on weapon type
Making sure the sprite is explicitly set to visible


Improving equip_weapon Function:

Properly removing the old weapon from the scene tree before freeing it
Making sure signals are disconnected
Adding signal connections for the new weapon
Forcing a visual update through update_appearance()
Resetting attack state to prevent state lock


Adding Detailed Debug Output:

More verbose logging in perform_attack function
Specific weapon type and name information
State tracking for attack flow



To implement these changes:

First, update your weapon.gd with the enhanced update_appearance and perform_attack functions
Then update your player.gd with the new perform_attack and equip_weapon functions
Add the new _on_weapon_used callback to your player.gd

These changes should make the weapon switching visible and functional. The logs will also provide more information to diagnose any remaining issues.
If the problem persists, we can add even more thorough debugging, but these changes address the most likely causes of your issue.RetryAHere is a selection:Player 1 attempting to equip weapon ID: fire_staff

Now we have created a staff, have we made the staff the same as the sword in its attack style? Remember we had a whole script that allowed us to change the speed and length of time that projectile lasted for. Has that disappeared?EditYou've just identified the critical issue! Your observation is spot on - we've lost the specialized functionality of different weapon types in our transition to the data-driven approach.
The logs confirm this: the weapon is correctly changing (your debug output shows "Player 1 equipped: Fire Staff (Type: staff)"), but we've lost the specialized staff behavior that made it visually and functionally different from the sword.
Here's what happened:

In the original system, you had separate scripts (sword.gd, magic_staff.gd) that defined unique behaviors for each weapon type.
When we moved to the data-driven approach, we created a single Weapon class that reads stats from a database but doesn't implement type-specific behaviors like projectiles.

To fix this, we need to restore weapon-specific behaviors while keeping the data-driven approach. Here's how we can modify the Weapon class to handle different weapon types:
gdscriptCopy# In weapon.gd
func perform_attack():
    if !can_attack:
        return false
        
    # Start cooldown
    can_attack = false
    if cooldown_timer:
        cooldown_timer.start()
    
    # Execute attack based on weapon type
    var weapon_type = get_weapon_type()
    match weapon_type:
        "sword":
            perform_sword_attack()
        "staff":
            perform_staff_attack()

This implementation:

Maintains the data-driven approach
Adds specialized attack methods for different weapon types
Recreates the projectile behavior for staff weapons
Makes sword and staff visually and functionally distinct

I recommend implementing this in your weapon.gd file to restore the specialized weapon behaviors while keeping the benefits of your new data-driven system.RetryweapongdACan you rewrite with this new functionality?EditWeapon with Specialized AttacksClick to open codeTap to openI've rewritten the weapon.gd script to include specialized attack behavior for different weapon types, restoring the functionality you had in your original system.
The key changes include:

Specialized Attack Methods:

Added perform_sword_attack() for melee weapons
Added perform_staff_attack() for projectile-based attacks
Modified perform_attack() to call the appropriate specialized function based on weapon type


Projectile System for Staves:

Created a complete projectile system for staff attacks
Added collision detection and damage application for projectiles
Used tweens for projectile movement
Added proper cleanup when projectiles hit or expire


Enhanced Visual Differentiation:

Improved update_appearance() to create visually distinct shapes for each weapon type
Swords now show as horizontal rectangles
Staves appear as vertical sticks with orbs at the top


Better Effect Handling:

Added a new _on_projectile_hit() method specifically for staff projectiles
Used metadata to store damage information with projectiles



This approach gives you the best of both worlds - the data-driven flexibility of your new system along with the specialized weapon behaviors of your original implementation. Players will now visually see the difference between weapons, and staves will once again fire projectiles instead of doing melee attacks.
Replace your current weapon.gd with this updated version to implement these changes.RetryAOk! We are getting somewhere!EditGreat! It sounds like we're making progress with the weapon system. Now you should be seeing distinct visuals for different weapon types and specialized attack behavior, particularly with staves firing projectiles instead of performing melee attacks.
Is everything working as expected now? Are you seeing the visual differences and specialized attack behaviors when switching between weapons? If you're encountering any additional issues or would like further refinements to the weapons system, let me know and I'd be happy to help!RetryAThere are two issues, I have been able to replicate the bugs consistently so I have an idea what is causing them (well, the first one, I don't know what causes the second one). 
1) When picking up the projectile weapon and firing, the fireball reached its full extent, but then it hung in the air and stayed there for the rest of the round. I tried to replicate this but couldn't until I fired a projectile just before picking up a new weapon, so that the projectile was still on screen (had not been destroyed) before I picked up the new weapon. So the order is: fired projectile, pickup weapon, fireball still remains on screen. If I did this again, fire projectile, pick up weapon while projectile still on screen, then another projectile would stay on the screen until the end of the match.
2) This issue is also consistent - the path of the projectile is not straight ahead, once fired, it rises and falls just like the player that fires it. So if the player fires the fireball, and then jumps up, the path of the projectil mimics this rise and fall.Do you understand the issues?EditI understand both issues you're encountering with the projectiles:

Lingering Projectiles: When you pick up a new weapon while a projectile is still on screen, the projectile gets "orphaned" and stays on screen indefinitely. This happens because the projectile's lifecycle is tied to the weapon that created it, and when that weapon is destroyed (when picking up a new one), the cleanup code for the projectile is lost.
Projectile Following Player Movement: The projectiles are following the player's movement instead of traveling in a straight line. This suggests that the projectile's position is being updated relative to the player rather than moving independently in world space.

Let me fix both issues:Fixed Projectile SystemClick to open codeTap to openI've created a fixed version of the projectile system that addresses both issues:

Fix for Lingering Projectiles:

Projectiles are now added to the scene root instead of as children of the wielder
Each projectile has its own self-contained script with lifetime management
The projectile cleans itself up when its lifetime expires
Added NOTIFICATION_PREDELETE handler to ensure cleanup if the parent is freed
Added validity checks before accessing projectile properties


Fix for Projectiles Following Player:

Using global_position instead of local position
Projectiles are now added to the scene root (not as children of the player)
Movement is handled directly by the projectile script without tweens
Fixed velocity is applied in _process() rather than using a tween



To implement this fix:

Open your weapon.gd script
Replace the perform_staff_attack() and _on_projectile_hit() functions with these updated versions
Keep the rest of your weapon.gd script the same

These changes should resolve both issues you're encountering with the projectiles. The projectiles will now travel in a straight line regardless of player movement, and they won't get orphaned when you pick up a new weapon.RetryAWait. We are hardcoding a script that relates solely to the staff projectile. If we are preparing for hundreds of new weapons, shouldn't it be more flexible? Maybe I want to add a gun at some point, or a fireball from a glove, or etc etc etcEditYou're absolutely right - hardcoding specific weapon behaviors directly in the weapon script isn't scalable for hundreds of weapons. Let's create a more flexible approach that can accommodate different projectile-based weapons.
Here's a better architecture that maintains the data-driven approach while supporting different attack styles:Flexible Weapon Attack SystemClick to open codeTap to openYou're absolutely right about needing a more flexible approach for hundreds of weapons. I've redesigned the system to be truly data-driven rather than type-specific:
Key Improvements

Attack Style System Instead of Weapon Type:

Weapons now have an "attack_style" property instead of hardcoded behavior by type
Currently supports "melee", "projectile", "beam", and "aoe" styles
New attack styles can be added without modifying weapon types


Projectile Configuration via Data:

All projectile properties (speed, lifetime, size, color) are defined in the weapon data
Different projectile weapons (staff, bow, gun) can reuse the same code with different settings


Extensibility for Future Weapons:

Added placeholder functions for beam and AOE attacks
The system is designed so you can add new attack styles without rewriting existing ones


Effects System:

Cleaned up the effects system to be more modular
Effects are passed from weapon to projectiles to targets



Implementation
To implement this more flexible system:

Update your weapon_database.gd to include "attack_style" and style-specific properties
Replace the perform_attack() function in weapon.gd with the new version
Add the new specialized attack functions (perform_melee_attack, perform_projectile_attack, etc.)
Update _on_projectile_hit and add apply_effect_to_target

This architecture gives you the flexibility you need for hundreds of weapons while maintaining the data-driven approach. You can create new weapons by simply adding entries to the database with different attack styles and properties - no need to write new code for each weapon type.RetryACan you update and rewrite the whole weapon.gd?EditI'll rewrite the entire weapon.gd script with the new flexible attack system:Complete Flexible Weapon SystemClick to open codeTap to openHere's the complete rewrite of weapon.gd with the flexible attack system. This version:

Uses a data-driven approach for all weapon behaviors

Attack styles (melee, projectile, beam, aoe) determined from weapon data
Specialized functions for each attack style
All properties configurable through weapon data


Improves projectile handling

Projectiles added to scene root instead of as player children
Self-contained scripts that manage their own lifecycle
Clear separation between projectile and weapon logic


Expands visual differentiation

Different visual representations based on attack style
Customizable colors based on weapon type and tier
Different projectile visuals configurable via data


Adds expandable effects system

Effects passed from weapons to projectiles to targets
Separate handling for visual effects and target effects
Framework for new effects like fire, ice, lightning, poison


Provides future expansion points

Placeholder functions for beam and AOE attacks
Consistent structure that can be extended with new attack styles



This design allows you to add hundreds of weapons by simply adding entries to the weapon database - no code changes needed unless you're introducing entirely new attack styles. Each weapon can have its own appearance, properties, and behavior while using the same underlying code.
To use this system, simply replace your entire weapon.gd file with this new version, and update your weapon database entries to include the "attack_style" field and style-specific properties.
