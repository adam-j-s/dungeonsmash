Creating a 2D Smash Bros-style Game in Godot
9+

Shared
A
Can you take me step by step through creating a 2D smash bros style game in Godot?
I want the game to be like battle mode in super mario bros 3. Do you know what battle mode was like?

Edit
I'd be happy to walk you through creating a 2D Smash Bros-style game in Godot, drawing inspiration from Super Mario Bros 3's battle mode! Let me first confirm my understanding of Super Mario Bros 3's battle mode:

In SMB3's battle mode, two players faced off in a single-screen arena. Each player controlled either Mario or Luigi, and the goal was to defeat your opponent by either jumping on them or using power-ups. Players could collect power-ups from blocks, and the arenas had various platforms and obstacles. It was a simple but fun competitive mode.

Let's create our Smash Bros-style game step by step:

Step 1: Setting Up the Godot Project
Download and install Godot Engine (version 4.x is recommended)
Create a new project:
Open Godot and click "New Project"
Name it "SmashClone" or whatever you prefer
Choose a location to save it
Select "2D" as the renderer
Click "Create & Edit"
Step 2: Project Organization
Let's set up a good folder structure:

In the FileSystem dock, right-click and create these folders:
scenes (for game scenes)
scripts (for GDScript files)
assets (for sprites, sounds, etc.)
assets/sprites
assets/audio
Step 3: Creating the Battle Arena
Create a new scene (Scene > New Scene)
Add a Node2D as the root node and rename it to "BattleArena"
Save the scene as scenes/battle_arena.tscn
Add a TileMap node as a child of BattleArena
We'll use this to create our platforms and terrain
Set up the TileMap:
Create a new TileSet resource for the TileMap
Import platform sprites into your assets/sprites folder
Add the sprites to your TileSet
Design your battle arena with platforms, similar to SMB3's battle arenas
Step 4: Creating the Player Character
Create a new scene (Scene > New Scene)
Add a CharacterBody2D as the root node and rename it to "Player"
Save the scene as scenes/player.tscn
Add child nodes to Player:
CollisionShape2D (set an appropriate shape, like a capsule)
Sprite2D (for the character's appearance)
AnimationPlayer (for animations)
Create the player script:
Attach a new script to the Player node
Save it as scripts/player.gd
Implement the basic movement physics
Here's a basic player script:

gdscript

Copy
extends CharacterBody2D

# Player movement parameters
@export var move_speed = 400.0
@export var jump_force = 600.0
@export var gravity = 1500.0
@export var max_jumps = 2  # Double jump like in Smash Bros

# Player state
var jumps_made = 0
var attacking = false
var facing_right = true
var health = 100

# Get references to nodes
@onready var animation_player = $AnimationPlayer
@onready var sprite = $Sprite2D

func _physics_process(delta):
    # Apply gravity
    if not is_on_floor():
        velocity.y += gravity * delta
    else:
        jumps_made = 0  # Reset jumps when on floor
    
    # Handle jump
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("jump") and jumps_made < max_jumps:
        velocity.y = -jump_force
        jumps_made += 1
    
    # Handle horizontal movement
    var direction = Input.get_axis("move_left", "move_right")
    velocity.x = direction * move_speed
    
    # Update facing direction
    if direction != 0:
        facing_right = direction > 0
        sprite.flip_h = !facing_right
    
    # Move the character
    move_and_slide()
    
    # Handle attack
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("attack") and !attacking:
        attack()

func attack():
    attacking = true
    # Play attack animation
    animation_player.play("attack")
    # Create attack hitbox
    var hitbox = create_hitbox()
    # Wait for animation to finish
    await animation_player.animation_finished
    attacking = false
    
func create_hitbox():
    # Create a temporary hitbox for the attack
    var hitbox = Area2D.new()
    var collision = CollisionShape2D.new()
    var shape = RectangleShape2D.new()
    
    # Set up hitbox properties
    shape.size = Vector2(50, 30)
    collision.shape = shape
    
    # Position the hitbox in front of the player
    hitbox.position.x = 40 if facing_right else -40
    
    # Add to scene tree
    hitbox.add_child(collision)
    add_child(hitbox)
    
    # Connect signal for hit detection
    hitbox.body_entered.connect(_on_hitbox_body_entered)
    
    # Auto-remove hitbox after a short time
    await get_tree().create_timer(0.2).timeout
    hitbox.queue_free()
    
    return hitbox

func _on_hitbox_body_entered(body):
    if body is CharacterBody2D and body != self:
        # Deal damage to the other player
        body.take_damage(20, self)

func take_damage(amount, attacker):
    health -= amount
    
    # Calculate knockback direction
    var knockback_direction = global_position - attacker.global_position
    knockback_direction = knockback_direction.normalized()
    
    # Apply knockback (stronger when health is lower, like in Smash)
    var knockback_strength = 500 + (100 - health) * 10
    velocity = knockback_direction * knockback_strength
    
    # Check if player is defeated
    if health <= 0:
        defeated()

func defeated():
    # Player is defeated
    print("Player defeated!")
    # You could trigger game over or respawn logic here
Step 5: Setting Up Input Actions
Go to Project > Project Settings > Input Map
Add the following input actions:
move_left (Left Arrow, A key)
move_right (Right Arrow, D key)
jump (Space, W key, Up Arrow)
attack (Z key, J key)
special (X key, K key)
Step 6: Setting Up the Main Game Scene
Create a new scene (Scene > New Scene)
Add a Node as the root and rename it to "Main"
Save the scene as scenes/main.tscn
Instance the BattleArena scene as a child of Main
Instance two Player scenes as children of Main
Create a script for the Main scene:
Attach a new script to the Main node
Save it as scripts/main.gd
Handle gameplay logic, like respawning, score tracking, etc.
gdscript

Copy
extends Node

var player1_score = 0
var player2_score = 0
var max_score = 5  # First to 5 wins

@onready var player1 = $Player1
@onready var player2 = $Player2

func _ready():
    # Set up player input
    setup_player_input()
    
    # Connect player signals
    player1.connect("player_defeated", _on_player_defeated)
    player2.connect("player_defeated", _on_player_defeated)

func setup_player_input():
    # For player 1, we'll use the default inputs
    
    # For player 2, we need to create custom inputs
    # This is done by setting InputMap in Project Settings
    # But we'll check if the inputs exist here
    if !player2.is_in_group("player2"):
        player2.add_to_group("player2")

func _on_player_defeated(player):
    if player == player1:
        player2_score += 1
        respawn_player(player1)
    else:
        player1_score += 1
        respawn_player(player2)
    
    # Update UI
    update_score_display()
    
    # Check for game over
    if player1_score >= max_score or player2_score >= max_score:
        game_over()

func respawn_player(player):
    # Reset player health
    player.health = 100
    
    # Reposition player
    var spawn_points = $SpawnPoints.get_children()
    var spawn_index = randi() % spawn_points.size()
    player.global_position = spawn_points[spawn_index].global_position

func update_score_display():
    # Update the UI with current scores
    $UI/ScoreLabel.text = "Player 1: %d | Player 2: %d" % [player1_score, player2_score]

func game_over():
    # Show game over screen
    $UI/GameOverPanel.visible = true
    
    # Show winner
    var winner_text = "Player 1 Wins!" if player1_score > player2_score else "Player 2 Wins!"
    $UI/GameOverPanel/WinnerLabel.text = winner_text
    
    # Pause the game
    get_tree().paused = true
Step 7: Adding Power-ups (Like in SMB3)
Create a new scene for power-ups
Add an Area2D as the root node and rename it to "PowerUp"
Save the scene as scenes/power_up.tscn
Add child nodes:
CollisionShape2D
Sprite2D
AnimationPlayer (for effects)
Create a script for power-ups:
gdscript

Copy
extends Area2D

enum PowerUpType {FIRE_FLOWER, MUSHROOM, STAR, LEAF}
@export var type: PowerUpType = PowerUpType.MUSHROOM

func _ready():
    # Set up appearance based on type
    match type:
        PowerUpType.FIRE_FLOWER:
            $Sprite2D.texture = preload("res://assets/sprites/fire_flower.png")
        PowerUpType.MUSHROOM:
            $Sprite2D.texture = preload("res://assets/sprites/mushroom.png")
        PowerUpType.STAR:
            $Sprite2D.texture = preload("res://assets/sprites/star.png")
        PowerUpType.LEAF:
            $Sprite2D.texture = preload("res://assets/sprites/leaf.png")
    
    # Connect signal
    body_entered.connect(_on_body_entered)

func _on_body_entered(body):
    if body is CharacterBody2D:  # It's a player
        apply_effect(body)
        # Disappear after being collected
        queue_free()

func apply_effect(player):
    match type:
        PowerUpType.FIRE_FLOWER:
            player.give_fire_power()
        PowerUpType.MUSHROOM:
            player.heal(50)  # Restore health
        PowerUpType.STAR:
            player.give_invincibility(10)  # 10 seconds of invincibility
        PowerUpType.LEAF:
            player.give_leaf_power()  # Tail attack and float ability
Update the Player script to handle power-ups:
gdscript

Copy
# Add these functions to your player.gd script

func give_fire_power():
    # Enable fire projectile attack
    has_fire_power = true
    # Update player appearance
    $Sprite2D.modulate = Color(1, 0.7, 0.7)

func give_leaf_power():
    # Enable tail attack and floating
    has_leaf_power = true
    # Update player appearance
    $Sprite2D.modulate = Color(0.7, 1, 0.7)

func heal(amount):
    health = min(health + amount, 100)

func give_invincibility(duration):
    is_invincible = true
    $Sprite2D.modulate = Color(1, 1, 0.5)
    
    # Blink effect
    var tween = create_tween().set_loops()
    tween.tween_property($Sprite2D, "modulate:a", 0.5, 0.1)
    tween.tween_property($Sprite2D, "modulate:a", 1.0, 0.1)
    
    # End invincibility after duration
    await get_tree().create_timer(duration).timeout
    is_invincible = false
    $Sprite2D.modulate = Color(1, 1, 1)
    tween.kill()
Step 8: Creating a Simple UI
Create a new scene for the UI
Add a CanvasLayer as the root node and rename it to "UI"
Save the scene as scenes/ui.tscn
Add child nodes for score display, health bars, etc.
Instance the UI scene in the Main scene
Step 9: Creating a Title Screen
Create a new scene for the title screen
Add a Control node as the root
Save the scene as scenes/title_screen.tscn
Add UI elements like buttons, title image, etc.
Create a script to handle menu navigation
Step 10: Polishing the Game
Add sound effects and music
Add particle effects for impacts, jumps, etc.
Add screen shake and other juice to make the game feel good
Implement different arenas with unique layouts
Add character selection if you want multiple characters

Ok, you're going to have to go into a much more detailed step by step. 

For example, let's start here:

Step 3: Creating the Battle Arena
1. Create a new scene (Scene > New Scene)
2. Add a Node2D as the root node and rename it to "BattleArena"
3. Save the scene as scenes/battle_arena.tscn
4. Add a TileMap node as a child of BattleArena
   * We'll use this to create our platforms and terrain

Edit
You're right, let's go into much more detail for each step. I'll walk you through creating the Battle Arena with specific instructions:

Step 3: Creating the Battle Arena (Detailed Steps)
3.1: Create a new scene
In the Godot editor, click on "Scene" in the top menu
Click "New Scene" from the dropdown menu
You'll see a dialog asking you to select a root node type
3.2: Add and set up the root node
In the "Create Root Node" dialog, select "Node2D" (This is a basic 2D node)
Click "Create" to add it to your scene
In the Scene dock (top-left panel), right-click on the new Node2D
Select "Rename" from the context menu
Type "BattleArena" and press Enter
3.3: Save the scene
Press Ctrl+S (or Command+S on Mac) to open the save dialog
Navigate to your project folder
Create a new folder called "scenes" if it doesn't exist yet
Double-click on the "scenes" folder to enter it
In the "File name" field, type "battle_arena.tscn"
Click "Save"
3.4: Add a TileMap node
Right-click on the "BattleArena" node in the Scene dock
Hover over "Add Child Node" to see the node selection dialog
Type "TileMap" in the search box
Select "TileMap" from the results
Click "Create" to add it as a child of BattleArena
Verify the TileMap appears as a child node in the Scene dock
Rename it to "Terrain" by right-clicking it and selecting "Rename"
3.5: Set up the TileMap
Select the "Terrain" TileMap node in the Scene dock
Look at the Inspector panel (right side of the screen)
Find the "Tile Set" property, which should be empty
Click on the dropdown next to it and select "New TileSet"
A new TileSet resource will be created and assigned
3.6: Configure the TileSet
With the TileMap still selected, look for "TileSet" in the bottom panel (next to "Inspector", "Node", etc.)
Click on the "TileSet" tab to open the TileSet editor
In the TileSet editor, click on "Add Atlas" button (it looks like a grid)
You'll be prompted to select a texture. We need to create one first.
3.7: Create a simple tileset texture
We'll need to create or import a tileset image
For now, let's create a folder for our graphics:
In the FileSystem dock (bottom-left), right-click on "res://"
Select "Create Folder"
Name it "assets"
Right-click on the new "assets" folder
Select "Create Folder"
Name it "sprites"
Right-click on the new "sprites" folder
Select "Create Folder"
Name it "tiles"
3.8: Import a tileset texture
You'll need a tileset image file. For now, you can:
Use one from Godot's built-in demo assets
Download a free tileset from a site like OpenGameArt.org
Create your own using an image editor
Once you have an image file:
Drag and drop it into the "tiles" folder in the FileSystem dock
Or right-click on the "tiles" folder and select "Import" to browse for your file
3.9: Set up the Atlas in TileSet
Go back to the TileSet editor (bottom panel, "TileSet" tab)
Click "Add Atlas" again
Browse to your imported tileset image and select it
Click "Open"
You'll see your tileset appear in the editor
Set the "Tile Size" to match your tiles (common sizes are 16x16, 32x32, or 64x64 pixels)
Set "Separation" to the gap between tiles in your tileset (often 0,0 if tiles are packed)
3.10: Create tiles from the Atlas
In the TileSet editor, click on the "Select" tool (cursor icon)
Click and drag to select a rectangular region of tiles from your Atlas
Click "Create Tiles from Selection" (puzzle piece icon)
You should see your tiles appear in the "Tiles" panel below the Atlas
3.11: Add physics to your tiles
In the TileSet editor, click on the "Physics" tab (next to "Paint", "Select", etc.)
Select a tile you want to add collision to
Click "Add Collision" (+ icon)
Draw a collision shape on your tile (usually a rectangle covering the whole tile)
Repeat for each tile type that should have collision
3.12: Create a basic level layout
Switch back to the "Paint" tab in the TileSet editor
Select a tile to paint with from the "Tiles" panel
Click and drag in the main viewport to place tiles
Start by creating a floor at the bottom of the screen
Add some platforms at different heights
Remember that this is a battle arena, so create platforms that encourage jumping and movement
3.13: Adjust the camera view
Right-click on the "BattleArena" node in the Scene dock
Select "Add Child Node"
Search for and select "Camera2D"
Click "Create"
With the Camera2D selected, in the Inspector:
Set "Current" to "On" (this makes it the active camera)
Set "Position" to center of your arena
Adjust "Zoom" if needed (values less than 1 zoom out, greater than 1 zoom in)
For a 2D platformer, try values like (0.5, 0.5) to show more of the arena
3.14: Add boundaries to keep players in the arena
Right-click on the "BattleArena" node
Select "Add Child Node"
Search for and select "StaticBody2D"
Rename it to "Boundaries"
Add four CollisionShape2D children to the Boundaries node:
Right-click on "Boundaries" > "Add Child Node" > "CollisionShape2D"
Do this four times, naming them "LeftWall", "RightWall", "Floor", and "Ceiling"
3.15: Configure the boundary collision shapes
Select the "LeftWall" CollisionShape2D
In the Inspector, click on the "Shape" property dropdown
Select "New RectangleShape2D"
Set the "Size" to something tall and thin (e.g., 10 x 600)
Position it at the left edge of your arena
Repeat for the other boundaries, placing them appropriately
3.16: Final adjustments and testing
Save your scene (Ctrl+S or Command+S)
Click the "Play Scene" button (or F6) to test your battle arena
Use the arrow keys to navigate the view and make sure all platforms and boundaries are correctly placed
Press Esc to stop the scene and return to the editor
Make any necessary adjustments to the layout
This detailed walkthrough for Step 3 should help you create a solid battle arena for your game. Would you like me to continue with the next step in this level of detail, or would you like to focus on a different aspect of the game development process?

Ok, go back a second. I have made a tileset, called it Terrain, and I have imported a tile atlas and am ready to draw in the level. 
But, first I would like to draw a background. How do I do this?

Edit
You're right, let's add a background to your battle arena before you start drawing the level with tiles. Here's how to add a background in Godot:

Adding a Background to Your Battle Arena
Create a Sprite2D for the background
Select your "BattleArena" node in the Scene dock
Right-click and select "Add Child Node"
Search for "Sprite2D" and select it
Click "Create"
Rename this node to "Background" by right-clicking on it and selecting "Rename"
Set the z-index to ensure it's drawn behind other elements
With the "Background" node selected, look in the Inspector panel
Find the "CanvasItem" section
Look for "Z Index" property
Set it to a negative value like -100 (this ensures it renders behind everything else)
Import a background image
Create a folder for backgrounds if you haven't already:
In the FileSystem dock, right-click on "res://assets/sprites/"
Select "Create Folder"
Name it "backgrounds"
Import your background image:
Either drag and drop an image file into this folder
Or right-click on the folder and select "Import" to locate your file
Assign the background image to the Sprite2D
Select your "Background" node
In the Inspector, find the "Texture" property
Click the dropdown/empty box next to it
Select "Load"
Navigate to your background image file and select it
Click "Open"
Adjust the background position and scale
With the "Background" node still selected:
Use the Transform tools in the toolbar (top of the viewport) to position and scale the background
You can also set values directly in the Inspector:
Under "Transform", set "Position" to center it (typically the center of your view)
Under "Transform", adjust "Scale" to make it fit your arena
Alternative: Using a ColorRect for a simple color background
If you don't have a background image, you can use a solid color instead:
Instead of Sprite2D, add a "ColorRect" node as a child of "BattleArena"
Rename it to "Background"
Set its Z Index to -100
In the Inspector, under "Rect", set "Size" large enough to cover your entire arena
Under "Color", click on the color block to choose a background color
Alternative: Creating a parallax background
For a more dynamic background with depth:
Add a "ParallaxBackground" node as a child of "BattleArena"
Add a "ParallaxLayer" as a child of "ParallaxBackground"
Add a "Sprite2D" as a child of "ParallaxLayer"
Set the "Texture" of the Sprite2D to your background image
In the ParallaxLayer properties, adjust "Motion Scale" (e.g., 0.5, 0.5 for a slower scrolling effect)
Ensuring proper rendering order
Make sure your hierarchy is ordered correctly in the Scene dock:
Background (z-index: -100)
TileMap (Terrain)
Other game elements
Now you can proceed with drawing your level using the TileMap on top of this background. The background will serve as the visual foundation, while your platforms and terrain provide the playable elements of the stage.

How can I set the background to a plain color, like just black?

Edit
You can easily set a plain black background using a ColorRect node. Here's how to do it:

Add a ColorRect node for the background
Select your "BattleArena" node in the Scene dock
Right-click and select "Add Child Node"
Search for "ColorRect" and select it
Click "Create"
Rename this node to "Background" by right-clicking on it and selecting "Rename"
Set the z-index to ensure it's drawn behind other elements
With the "Background" node selected, look in the Inspector panel
Find the "CanvasItem" section
Look for "Z Index" property
Set it to a negative value like -100 (this ensures it renders behind everything else)
Make the ColorRect black
With the "Background" node still selected
In the Inspector, find the "Color" property (it's usually white by default)
Click on the white color box
In the color picker that appears, you can:
Set R, G, and B values all to 0 (which creates black)
Or click on the black area in the color picker
Or type "#000000" in the hex field
Click outside the color picker to apply the change
Size the ColorRect to cover the entire screen
In the Inspector, under the "Rect" section:
You can set "Size" to a large enough value to cover your entire game area
For example, 1920×1080 or larger
Alternatively, you can use the 2D editor's transform tools to resize it
Position it so it's centered in your game view
If you want the background to always cover the screen regardless of camera movement
You might want to consider making the ColorRect a child of a CanvasLayer instead:
Remove the ColorRect if you've already added it
Add a "CanvasLayer" node as a child of "BattleArena"
Set its "Layer" property to -1 (to ensure it's behind everything)
Add the "ColorRect" as a child of this CanvasLayer
Set the ColorRect color to black as described above
Size it to cover the screen
Now your battle arena will have a plain black background behind all your gameplay elements.

Ok, I have a background, and now I have painted tiles to create an arena. Now I need to makecertain areas have collision

Edit
Let's set up collision for your arena tiles. Here's a detailed walkthrough for adding collision to specific areas of your TileMap:

Adding Collision to Your Arena Tiles
Method 1: Add Collision to Specific Tile Types in the TileSet
Access the TileSet editor
Select your "Terrain" TileMap node in the Scene dock
Look for the "TileSet" panel at the bottom of the screen
Click on the "TileSet" tab to open the TileSet editor
Switch to the Physics mode
In the TileSet editor, look for the tabs at the top
Click on the "Physics" tab (it may have a collision shape icon)
Select tiles to add collision
In the tiles panel (showing all your tiles), click on a tile that you want to have collision
You can select multiple tiles by holding Shift or Ctrl while clicking
Add collision shapes
With your tile(s) selected, click the "+" button next to "Physics Layers"
This creates a new collision shape
By default, it may create a rectangle that covers the entire tile
If you need a custom shape, you can:
Select the collision shape
Use the points/vertices to modify it
For platforms, you might want just a rectangle on the top portion
Customize collision shapes if needed
For tiles that need specific collision shapes (like slopes):
Delete the default shape by selecting it and pressing Delete
Click "Create New Polygon"
Click to place points to form your collision shape
Click the first point again to close the shape
Repeat for all tile types that need collision
Go through each type of tile in your arena that should be solid
Make sure platforms, walls, and obstacles all have appropriate collision shapes
Method 2: Add StaticBody2D nodes for Custom Collision Areas
If you prefer to add collision separately from your tiles (or if some areas need special collision):

Add a StaticBody2D node
Right-click on your "BattleArena" node
Select "Add Child Node"
Search for "StaticBody2D"
Click "Create"
Rename it to something descriptive like "PlatformCollision"
Add a CollisionShape2D to the StaticBody2D
Right-click on your new StaticBody2D node
Select "Add Child Node"
Search for "CollisionShape2D"
Click "Create"
Configure the collision shape
With the CollisionShape2D selected
In the Inspector, click the dropdown next to "Shape"
Select "New RectangleShape2D" (or another shape that fits your needs)
Adjust the size and position to match your platform or obstacle
Position the collision shape
Use the Transform tools in the toolbar to:
Move the shape to align with your platform
Scale it to match the size of your platform
You can see the collision shape as a green outline in the editor
Add more collision shapes as needed
Repeat steps 2-4 for each separate platform or area that needs collision
You can add multiple CollisionShape2D nodes to a single StaticBody2D
Testing Your Collision
Save your scene (Ctrl+S or Command+S)
Create a quick test character (if you don't have one yet):
Add a CharacterBody2D node to your scene temporarily
Add a CollisionShape2D as its child
Add a basic script to it with movement and gravity
Run the scene (F6 or the "Play Scene" button)
Test if your character collides properly with the platforms
Check if you can jump on platforms and not fall through
Ensure collision feels right at edges and corners
Adjust as needed
If collision doesn't feel right, you may need to:
Adjust collision shape sizes/positions
Modify the physics layer settings
Refine the collision shapes on specific tiles
Once you've set up collision for all your platforms and obstacles, your arena will be ready for gameplay with proper physics interaction.

there is no physics tab. is this the most recent version of godot?

Edit
You're right, I apologize for the confusion. The TileSet editor interface changed between Godot versions, and I was describing an older version's workflow. Let me provide the correct steps for Godot 4.x:

Adding Collision to Tiles in Godot 4.x
Select your TileMap node in the Scene dock
Open the TileSet inspector
With the TileMap selected, you should see the TileSet property in the Inspector
Click on the TileSet resource to edit it
Add a physics layer to your TileSet
In the Inspector, find the "Physics Layers" section
Click the "Add Element" button to add a physics layer
You should now see "Layer 0" appear under Physics Layers
Set up the collision for your tiles
In the bottom panel, you should see the TileSet panel open
Make sure you're in the "Select" mode (cursor icon in the toolbar)
Click on a tile in your atlas that you want to add collision to
Look for the "Physics" section in the right panel of the TileSet editor
For the physics layer you created, click the icon that looks like a square/polygon
This will let you draw a collision shape for that specific tile
Draw the collision shape
Click to place points and create a polygon that outlines the solid part of your tile
For simple platform tiles, this would typically be a rectangle
Click on the first point to close the polygon
Repeat for all tiles that need collision
Select each tile type that should be solid and add a collision shape to it
For similar tiles, you can select multiple tiles at once before adding collision
If you're still not seeing these options, please let me know which specific version of Godot you're using (e.g., 4.0, 4.1, etc.), and I can provide the exact steps for that version.

The tilemap is on layer 0 but layer 0 does not show up when I clickthe physics layers add element, just from 1 upwards

Edit
I understand the issue you're facing with the physics layers. In Godot 4.x, the layer numbering in the UI can be a bit confusing. Let me clarify how to set up collision properly:

Correctly Adding Physics Collision in Godot 4.x
With your TileMap selected:
Look in the Inspector panel
Find the "TileSet" property section
Add a Physics Layer:
Under the TileSet section, find "Physics Layers"
Click the "Add Element" button
It will create "Layer 0" (even though it appears as Layer 1 in the dropdown)
This is normal - the first physics layer you add is always considered "Layer 0" internally
Name your physics layer (optional but recommended):
With the physics layer added, you should see a "name" field
You can name it something like "Solid" for clarity
Configure your collision tiles:
In the bottom panel's TileSet editor, select the tile(s) you want to add collision to
On the right side panel of the TileSet editor, look for the Physics section
You should see your newly created physics layer
Click the polygon/rectangle icon next to it
Now you can draw a collision shape for that tile
If you still don't see Layer 0:
The dropdown may start from 1, but the first layer you add is still treated as layer 0 internally
Just use the first available physics layer in the list
The important part is that you have a physics layer added and can draw collision shapes
This approach should work regardless of the layer numbering displayed in the UI. The key is to add a physics layer and then use it to define collision shapes for your tiles.

Does that help resolve the issue you're encountering?

i'm on 4.2.2 stable, shoudl I be on a different version?

Edit
You're on Godot 4.2.2 stable, which is an excellent version to use for your project. It's a recent stable release with good documentation and community support, so there's no need to switch to a different version.

The physics layer issue you're experiencing is likely just related to how Godot 4.x handles the UI for TileMap physics. Let me provide the exact steps for Godot 4.2.2:

Adding Collision in Godot 4.2.2
With your TileMap selected:
In the Inspector, find the TileSet property
Expand it to see its properties
Add a Physics Layer:
Find the "Physics Layers" section
Click the "Add Element" button
It will add a physics layer (the UI might show it as Layer 1, but it's actually Layer 0 internally)
Give it a name like "Collision" for clarity
Set up collision for your tiles:
In the bottom panel, make sure the TileSet tab is open
Select the "TileSet" subtab if not already selected
Select a tile or multiple tiles in your tileset that should have collision
In the right panel of the TileSet editor, look for the "Physics" section
For the physics layer you created, click the square/polygon icon
Now you can draw the collision shape:
Click to place points and create a polygon shape
For rectangular tiles, just create a rectangle shape
Click the first point again to close the shape
Apply to all necessary tiles:
Repeat the collision shape process for all tiles that need collision
For platform tiles, you can make the collision shape match just the top part if you want players to jump through from below
The numbering displayed in the UI (whether it starts from 0 or 1) isn't important as long as you have a physics layer added and can draw collision shapes for your tiles.

Godot 4.2.2 stable is a perfectly appropriate version for developing your Smash Bros-style game, so you're good to continue with it.

Ok, now let's add a character so that I can test that

Edit
Let's create a character to test your arena with collision. Here's a detailed walkthrough:

Adding a Test Character to Your Scene
1. Create a new Player scene
Create a new scene:
Click on "Scene" in the top menu
Select "New Scene"
In the "Create Root Node" dialog, search for "CharacterBody2D"
Select it and click "Create"
Rename the node:
Right-click on the CharacterBody2D node in the Scene dock
Select "Rename"
Name it "Player"
Add a collision shape:
Right-click on the Player node
Select "Add Child Node"
Search for "CollisionShape2D"
Click "Create"
With the CollisionShape2D selected, in the Inspector:
Click the dropdown next to "Shape"
Select "New CapsuleShape2D" (good for platformer characters)
Set the Height to around 40-50 (depending on your tile size)
Set the Radius to around 10-15
Add a visual representation:
Right-click on the Player node
Select "Add Child Node"
Search for "Sprite2D"
Click "Create"
With the Sprite2D selected:
In the Inspector, find the "Texture" property
Click the dropdown and select "Load"
Navigate to a character sprite or select "New GradientTexture2D" if you don't have one
If using GradientTexture2D, set the Width and Height to match your collision shape
Adjust the position to align with the collision shape
2. Create a basic movement script
Add a script to the Player node:
Right-click on the Player node
Select "Attach Script"
Keep the default location and name (Player.gd)
Click "Create"
Replace the script content with this basic platformer code:
gdscript

Copy
extends CharacterBody2D

# Player movement parameters
const SPEED = 300.0
const JUMP_VELOCITY = -400.0

# Get the gravity from the project settings
var gravity = ProjectSettings.get_setting("physics/2d/default_gravity")

func _physics_process(delta):
	# Add the gravity
	if not is_on_floor():
		velocity.y += gravity * delta

	# Handle Jump
	if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_accept") and is_on_floor():
		velocity.y = JUMP_VELOCITY

	# Get the input direction
	var direction = Input.get_axis("ui_left", "ui_right")
	
	# Handle movement
	if direction:
		velocity.x = direction * SPEED
	else:
		# Stop horizontal movement when no direction pressed
		velocity.x = move_toward(velocity.x, 0, SPEED)

	# Move the character
	move_and_slide()
	
	# Simple animation (flipping sprite based on direction)
	if direction > 0:
		$Sprite2D.flip_h = false
	elif direction < 0:
		$Sprite2D.flip_h = true
Save the Player scene:
Press Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac)
Navigate to your "scenes" folder
Name it "player.tscn"
Click "Save"
3. Add the Player to your Battle Arena scene
Open your Battle Arena scene if it's not already open
Instance the Player scene:
Right-click on your BattleArena node in the Scene dock
Select "Instance Child Scene"
Navigate to "scenes/player.tscn"
Click "Open"
Position the Player:
With the Player instance selected
Use the Move tool to position it above one of your platforms
Make sure it's slightly above the platform so it can fall onto it
4. Test the scene
Save your Battle Arena scene (Ctrl+S/Cmd+S)
Run the scene:
Press F6 or click the "Play Scene" button in the top-right corner
You should see your character fall onto a platform due to gravity
Test movement with the left and right arrow keys
Test jumping with the spacebar (or whatever key is mapped to "ui_accept")
Verify that collision works properly on all platforms
5. Troubleshooting common issues
If your character falls through platforms or has other collision issues:

Check collision layer compatibility:
Select your TileMap node
In the Inspector, find "Collision Layer" and "Collision Mask" properties
Make sure they're set to include Layer 1 (the default physics layer)
Do the same for your Player node - both should have compatible collision layers
Verify collision shapes:
Check that your tile collision shapes cover the appropriate areas
Ensure the Player's collision shape is properly sized and positioned
Check gravity settings:
If the Player falls too quickly or slowly, adjust the gravity value in the script
Debug with visibility toggles:
In the editor viewport, click the "Debug" dropdown in the top-right corner
Enable "Visible Collision Shapes" to see all collision boundaries
This helps identify any misalignment issues
This should give you a working test character to verify your arena's collision. Once you confirm everything works correctly, you can further develop the character with additional animations, abilities, and game mechanics.

Ok, the arena doesn't have collision. I'm struggling to find how to add collision as a 'paint' tool. I have already painted the arena scene. How do I add collision to it? Or would it be easier to repaint the scene?

Edit
It sounds like you've already painted your arena with tiles but haven't set up collision yet. No need to repaint! Let's add collision to your existing tiles:

Adding Collision to Your Existing TileMap in Godot 4.2.2
1. First, set up a physics layer for your TileSet:
Select your TileMap node in the Scene dock
In the Inspector panel, find the "TileSet" property
Expand it if needed to see all properties
Look for "Physics Layers" and click the "Add Element" button
This will create a new physics layer (it might show as Layer 1, but it's Layer 0 internally)
You can name it "Collision" for clarity
2. Now, to add collision to your existing painted tiles:
With your TileMap still selected, go to the bottom panel
Make sure the "TileSet" tab is selected
Look for the "Painting" section at the top of this panel
Next to "Painting", you should see several icons - look for "Select" mode (cursor icon)
Switch to "Select" mode by clicking this icon
3. Select tiles in your atlas that need collision:
In the TileSet panel, you'll see your tile atlas displayed
Click on a tile type that you've used for platforms/ground in your arena
You can select multiple tiles by holding Shift or Ctrl while clicking
Select all the tile types that should have collision
4. Add collision shapes to the selected tiles:
With your tiles selected, look at the right side of the TileSet panel
Find the "Physics" section
Under your physics layer (likely labeled "0: Collision"), click the polygon/shape icon
This will let you draw collision shapes for the selected tiles
Click to create points forming a polygon that outlines the solid part of the tile
For simple full-tile collision, just draw a rectangle covering the entire tile
Click on your first point to close the shape
5. Test your changes:
Save your scene
Run it with your test character
The character should now collide with the tiles where you added collision shapes
Important tip:
In Godot 4.2.2, you don't "paint" collision directly. Instead, you:

Paint the visual tiles first (which you've already done)
Add collision shapes to the tile types in your TileSet
All instances of those tiles in your TileMap will automatically get the collision properties
If you're still having trouble, it might be helpful to take a step back and check:

Did the physics layer get added successfully?
Are you able to select your atlas tiles and see the physics properties?
After adding collision shapes, can you see them when you enable "Visible Collision Shapes" in the debug view?
Let me know if you need more specific guidance on any of these steps!

Woohoo! That did it! I now have a character and collisions with the ground! Fantastic!

Edit
Great job! That's a crucial milestone in creating your platformer game. Having your character interact properly with the environment is the foundation for all the gameplay mechanics you'll build on top of it.

Now that you have a character moving around with proper collisions, you can start building out the more exciting features of your Smash Bros-style battle game:

Improve character controls:
Add double jumping
Implement air movement control
Add wall jumping or sliding
Add attacks and combat:
Implement basic attacks (punch, kick)
Add special moves
Create hitboxes for dealing damage
Add knockback physics
Health/damage system:
Track player health/damage percentage
Increase knockback based on damage (like in Smash)
Add visual damage indicators
Power-ups:
Create collectible items that spawn on the stage
Add special abilities when collected
Camera and boundaries:
Implement a camera that follows players
Add blast zones/death areas when falling off stage
Which of these aspects would you like to tackle next? Or is there something else you'd like to focus on for your battle game?

Well, first I need to fix the player character. WEhen I loaded the sprite, it is a tileset of lots of images in a long line, so it has lots of animations across a single line of sprites. So I need to change that so for now I just want to select one of the sprites as the character player.

Edit
Let's fix your player character by selecting just one sprite from your sprite sheet/tileset. Here's how to do that:

Selecting a Single Sprite from a Sprite Sheet
Select your Player node in the Scene dock
Adjust the Sprite2D settings:
Select the Sprite2D node under your Player
In the Inspector panel, find the "Region" section
Enable "Region Enabled" by checking the box
This allows you to select only a portion of the sprite sheet
Set the region rectangle:
With "Region Enabled" checked, you'll see additional properties appear
Set "Region Rect":
X: The horizontal position of your desired sprite (in pixels)
Y: The vertical position of your desired sprite (in pixels)
W: The width of a single sprite/frame (in pixels)
H: The height of a single sprite/frame (in pixels)
Fine-tune the selection:
You may need to adjust these values to precisely select one character frame
For example, if your sprites are 32x32 pixels and the one you want is the third in the row:
X would be 64 (32×2)
Y would be 0
W would be 32
H would be 32
Visual adjustment:
You can also adjust the region visually by:
With the Sprite2D selected, look for the "Sprite" section at the top of the editor
Click on "Region" in this section
Use the handles that appear on the sprite to drag and resize the region rectangle
Center the texture:
After selecting the region, your sprite's origin might be off
In the Inspector, find "Offset" under the Texture section
Set "Centered" to On if you want the sprite centered on the character's position
This should let you select just one frame from your sprite sheet to use as your character. Once you have that working, you can later implement proper animations by using an AnimatedSprite2D node or animation frames with your existing Sprite2D.

how do I flip the character so it faces the other way

Edit
To flip your character sprite so it faces the other direction, you have a couple of options:

Method 1: Using the Sprite2D properties
Select the Sprite2D node that's a child of your Player
In the Inspector panel, look for the "Sprite2D" or "Node2D" section
Find the "Flip H" property and check the box
This will horizontally flip the sprite, making it face the opposite direction
"Flip H" stands for "Flip Horizontally"
Method 2: Handling it in code (recommended)
This method is better for gameplay since you can dynamically flip the sprite based on movement direction:

Open your Player.gd script
Find or add code that handles movement direction
Add logic to flip the sprite based on direction:
gdscript

Copy
# In your _physics_process function, after handling movement:

# Get the input direction
var direction = Input.get_axis("ui_left", "ui_right")

# Handle movement
if direction:
    velocity.x = direction * SPEED
    # Flip sprite based on direction
    if direction > 0:  # Moving right
        $Sprite2D.flip_h = false  # Default orientation
    else:  # Moving left
        $Sprite2D.flip_h = true   # Flipped orientation
else:
    # Stop horizontal movement when no direction pressed
    velocity.x = move_toward(velocity.x, 0, SPEED)
This code will automatically flip your character sprite to face left when moving left, and face right when moving right.

If you notice the sprite is facing the wrong way by default (e.g., facing left when you want it to face right), you can adjust the initial state and reverse the logic.




Retry
A
Ah, no, it seems the problem is that it flips the character as I move, so even when I flip H, when I then run, it flips again the wrong way

Edit
I understand the issue now. Your character is being flipped automatically in your movement code, but it's flipping the wrong way. Let's fix this by adjusting the logic in your script.

First, let's check your current Player.gd script. It probably has code similar to this:

gdscript

Copy
# In your _physics_process function
if direction > 0:
    $Sprite2D.flip_h = false
elif direction < 0:
    $Sprite2D.flip_h = true
The issue is likely that your sprite's default orientation is different from what the code expects. Let's modify this logic:

Open your Player.gd script
Find the section where the sprite flipping happens (usually after handling movement)
Reverse the flip logic by changing it to:
gdscript

Copy
# Modified sprite flipping logic
if direction > 0:  # Moving right
    $Sprite2D.flip_h = true  # Flipped
elif direction < 0:  # Moving left
    $Sprite2D.flip_h = false  # Not flipped
This reverses the logic, so when moving right, the sprite will be flipped, and when moving left, it won't be flipped.

If you're still having issues, you might want to:

Set the initial orientation manually in your _ready() function:
gdscript

Copy
func _ready():
    # Set initial orientation (adjust true/false based on which way looks correct)
    $Sprite2D.flip_h = true  # or false
Test which direction looks correct first, then implement the dynamic flipping based on that.
The key is to first determine which orientation (flipped or non-flipped) looks correct for each direction, then update your code to match.




Retry

Ok, now I guess a double jump would be good

Edit
Let's add a double jump to your character! This will make your platformer feel more like a Smash Bros-style game. Here's how to implement it:

Modify your Player.gd script to track the number of jumps:
gdscript

Copy
extends CharacterBody2D

# Player movement parameters
const SPEED = 300.0
const JUMP_VELOCITY = -400.0

# Get the gravity from the project settings
var gravity = ProjectSettings.get_setting("physics/2d/default_gravity")

# Jump variables
var jumps_available = 2  # Maximum number of jumps (2 means normal jump + one mid-air jump)
var jumps_made = 0

func _physics_process(delta):
	# Add the gravity
	if not is_on_floor():
		velocity.y += gravity * delta
	else:
		# Reset jumps when touching the floor
		jumps_made = 0

	# Handle Jump
	if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_accept") and jumps_made < jumps_available:
		velocity.y = JUMP_VELOCITY
		jumps_made += 1

	# Get the input direction
	var direction = Input.get_axis("ui_left", "ui_right")
	
	# Handle movement
	if direction:
		velocity.x = direction * SPEED
		# Adjust flip direction as needed
		if direction > 0:
			$Sprite2D.flip_h = true  # or false, depending on your sprite
		elif direction < 0:
			$Sprite2D.flip_h = false  # or true, depending on your sprite
	else:
		# Stop horizontal movement when no direction pressed
		velocity.x = move_toward(velocity.x, 0, SPEED)

	# Move the character
	move_and_slide()
The key changes are:

Added jumps_available = 2 to specify max jumps
Added jumps_made to track jumps used
Reset jumps_made when touching the floor
Changed the jump condition to jumps_made < jumps_available
Increment jumps_made when jumping
You can customize this further:

Change jumps_available to allow more or fewer mid-air jumps
Add a different jump sound for the second jump
Make the second jump height different by using a different velocity
Add a small visual effect (like a puff of air) for the second jump
Test your character now - you should be able to press the jump button once to jump normally, then press it again mid-air to perform a double jump!

Great. How do I play with gravity a little to give it a bit more weight?

Edit
To give your character more weight and a better feel through gravity adjustments, you can modify a few key parameters. Here's how to tweak the gravity and jumping physics:

gdscript

Copy
extends CharacterBody2D

# Player movement parameters
const SPEED = 300.0
const JUMP_VELOCITY = -400.0
const FALL_MULTIPLIER = 1.5  # Makes falling faster than rising
const LOW_JUMP_MULTIPLIER = 1.2  # For shorter jumps when button is released quickly

# Get the gravity from the project settings, but we'll modify it
var base_gravity = ProjectSettings.get_setting("physics/2d/default_gravity")

# Jump variables
var jumps_available = 2
var jumps_made = 0

func _physics_process(delta):
	# Apply gravity with better game feel
	if not is_on_floor():
		# Apply stronger gravity when falling
		if velocity.y > 0:
			velocity.y += base_gravity * FALL_MULTIPLIER * delta
		# Apply weaker gravity when rising but player released jump button
		elif velocity.y < 0 && !Input.is_action_pressed("ui_accept"):
			velocity.y += base_gravity * LOW_JUMP_MULTIPLIER * delta
		# Normal gravity when rising
		else:
			velocity.y += base_gravity * delta
	else:
		# Reset jumps when touching the floor
		jumps_made = 0

	# Handle Jump
	if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_accept") and jumps_made < jumps_available:
		velocity.y = JUMP_VELOCITY
		jumps_made += 1

	# Get the input direction and handle movement
	var direction = Input.get_axis("ui_left", "ui_right")
	
	if direction:
		velocity.x = direction * SPEED
		# Adjust flip direction as needed based on your sprite orientation
		if direction > 0:
			$Sprite2D.flip_h = true  # or false, depending on your sprite
		elif direction < 0:
			$Sprite2D.flip_h = false  # or true, depending on your sprite
	else:
		# Stop horizontal movement when no direction pressed
		velocity.x = move_toward(velocity.x, 0, SPEED)

	# Move the character
	move_and_slide()
The key adjustments here are:

Added a FALL_MULTIPLIER (1.5): This makes the character fall faster than it rises, giving it a weightier feel. Increasing this makes the game feel more responsive.
Added a LOW_JUMP_MULTIPLIER (1.2): This gives better jump control by making the character fall faster when the player releases the jump button early.
Different gravity based on state:
Stronger gravity when falling down (velocity.y > 0)
Slightly increased gravity when rising but jump button released
Normal gravity when actively jumping upward
You can adjust these values to fine-tune how your character feels:

For heavier characters: Increase FALL_MULTIPLIER to 1.8-2.0
For floatier jumps: Decrease FALL_MULTIPLIER to 1.2-1.3
For more responsive controls: Increase LOW_JUMP_MULTIPLIER to 1.4-1.5
These physics adjustments are inspired by games like Super Mario Bros and Celeste, which use variable gravity to create satisfying platforming feel.

I'd also like to include a variable dash. See, my thought is, I would like there to be a number of different characters, with dfifferent abilities (faster dash, heavier....what are some other variables I could do?) Remember the theme is like a fantasy dungeon type game.

Edit
Adding variable dash and different character abilities is a fantastic idea for your fantasy dungeon battle game! Here's how to implement a dash mechanic and some character class ideas with different attributes:

Implementing Variable Dash

	if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_accept") and jumps_made < jumps_available:
		velocity.y = JUMP_VELOCITY
		jumps_made += 1
	
	# Get the input direction
	var direction = Input.get_axis("ui_left", "ui_right")
	
	# Handle dash (assuming you map it to Shift key or "ui_dash")
	if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_dash") and can_dash and direction != 0:
		start_dash(direction)
	
	if is_dashing:
		# During dash, maintain dash velocity
		pass
	else:

		if direction:
			velocity.x = direction * SPEED
			if direction > 0:
				$Sprite2D.flip_h = true
			elif direction < 0:
				$Sprite2D.flip_h = false
		else:
			velocity.x = move_toward(velocity.x, 0, SPEED)
	
	move_and_slide()

func start_dash(direction):
	is_dashing = true
	can_dash = false
	
	# Set dash velocity
	velocity.x = direction * DASH_SPEED
	velocity.y = 0  # No vertical movement during dash
	
	# Optional: Add a dash effect/animation here
	
	# End dash after duration
	await get_tree().create_timer(DASH_DURATION).timeout
	is_dashing = false
	
	# Reset dash after cooldown
	await get_tree().create_timer(DASH_COOLDOWN).timeout
	can_dash = true
First, you'll need to add an input mapping for the dash:

Go to Project > Project Settings > Input Map
Add a new action "ui_dash"
Assign it to Shift key or whatever you prefer
Character Classes with Different Abilities
Here are some fantasy-themed character classes with different variables you could implement:

1. Knight
Attributes: Medium speed, high health, heavy (high fall speed)
Special: Shield block (reduces knockback and damage briefly)
Variables to adjust:
DASH_SPEED = 700
FALL_MULTIPLIER = 1.8
Health = 120%
2. Rogue/Thief
Attributes: Fast, light, multiple dashes
Special: Smoke bomb (temporary invisibility)
Variables to adjust:
SPEED = 350
DASH_SPEED = 900
DASH_COOLDOWN = 0.4
FALL_MULTIPLIER = 1.3
Health = 80%
3. Mage
Attributes: Slow, floaty jumps, ranged attacks
Special: Teleport (instant position change)
Variables to adjust:
SPEED = 250
JUMP_VELOCITY = -450
FALL_MULTIPLIER = 1.2
Health = 70%
4. Barbarian
Attributes: Medium speed, super heavy, powerful attacks
Special: Rage (temporary damage boost)
Variables to adjust:
SPEED = 280
FALL_MULTIPLIER = 2.0
DASH_SPEED = 850
Health = 150%
5. Ranger/Archer
Attributes: Medium-fast, good air control
Special: Wall cling, charged arrows
Variables to adjust:
SPEED = 320
Air control modifier = 0.9
DASH_COOLDOWN = 0.6
Health = 90%
6. Cleric/Healer
Attributes: Medium speed, gradual health regeneration
Special: Area heal (helps teammates in multiplayer)
Variables to adjust:
Adds health_regen_timer
DASH_DURATION = 0.15
Health = 100%
Additional Character Variables You Could Implement:
Weight: Affects knockback resistance and fall speed
Air control: How much movement control during jumps
Attack range: Melee vs mid-range vs long-range
Attack speed: Time between attacks
Armor: Damage reduction percentage
Critical hit chance: Random bonus damage chance
Dodge chance: Chance to avoid damage
Mana/energy pool: For special abilities
Wall jump ability: Some characters could wall jump, others can't
Special movement: Teleport, grappling hook, blink
Status effect resistance: Some characters resist certain effects
Unique weapon types: Different attack patterns
To implement character selection, you could create a base Character script that all your characters extend from, then modify the specific attributes for each character class. This would let players choose their preferred playstyle based on these different variables.

It looks like you're getting syntax errors with the exported variables. In GDScript, the syntax for export variables needs the @export annotation instead of just export. Let me fix that for you:

gdscript

This change from export to @export is specific to Godot 4.x, which uses the new annotation-style syntax for exports. If you're using Godot 4.2.2 as you mentioned earlier, this updated code should work correctly.

Don't forget to also add the "ui_dash" input mapping in Project Settings > Input Map so your dash ability will work!

I notice we haven't done anything in the input map yet but the character is registering my key presses. I want left shift to be dash, but how can I add that if we haven't configured the input map?

Edit
You're right to notice that! The default Godot project comes with some pre-configured inputs like "ui_left", "ui_right", and "ui_accept" which is why those are working without you having to configure them. However, "ui_dash" is not a default input, so we need to add it explicitly.

Here's how to add the dash input mapping:

Open the Project Settings:
Click on "Project" in the top menu
Select "Project Settings"
Navigate to Input Map:
In the Project Settings window, click on the "Input Map" tab near the top
Add a new action:
In the "Add New Action" field at the top, type "ui_dash"
Click the "Add" button
Assign Left Shift to this action:
Find your newly created "ui_dash" action in the list
Click the "+" button to the right of it
In the dropdown, select "Key"
A dialog will appear - press the Left Shift key
It should show "Shift" in the input field
Click "OK"
Save your settings:
Click "OK" at the bottom of the Project Settings window to save your changes
Now your script will be able to detect when the player presses Left Shift via the Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_dash") line in your code.

Once you've set this up, test your game to make sure the dash works when you press Left Shift while moving!

Now, if I want to add a double dash to some characters, or say, on a pickup, how would I do that?

Edit
To add a double dash capability (either as a character-specific ability or as a temporary power-up), you'll need to modify your dash system. Here's how you can implement it:

Implementing Double Dash
First, let's modify your Player script to track multiple dash charges:

gdscript

Copy
extends CharacterBody2D

# Base attributes
@export var SPEED = 300.0
@export var JUMP_VELOCITY = -400.0
@export var FALL_MULTIPLIER = 1.5
@export var LOW_JUMP_MULTIPLIER = 1.2
@export var DASH_SPEED = 800.0
@export var DASH_DURATION = 0.2
@export var DASH_COOLDOWN = 0.8
@export var MAX_DASH_CHARGES = 1  # Default is 1, set to 2 for double dash characters

# Character state tracking
var jumps_available = 2
var jumps_made = 0
var dash_charges = 1  # Current available dashes
var is_dashing = false
var base_gravity = ProjectSettings.get_setting("physics/2d/default_gravity")

func _ready():
    # Initialize dash charges to max at start
    dash_charges = MAX_DASH_CHARGES

func _physics_process(delta):
    if is_dashing:
        # Skip gravity when dashing
        pass
    elif not is_on_floor():
        # Apply gravity with better game feel
        if velocity.y > 0:
            velocity.y += base_gravity * FALL_MULTIPLIER * delta
        elif velocity.y < 0 && !Input.is_action_pressed("ui_accept"):
            velocity.y += base_gravity * LOW_JUMP_MULTIPLIER * delta
        else:
            velocity.y += base_gravity * delta
    else:
        # Reset jumps when touching the floor
        jumps_made = 0
        # Also refill dash charges when touching ground
        if dash_charges < MAX_DASH_CHARGES:
            dash_charges = MAX_DASH_CHARGES
    
    # Handle Jump
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_accept") and jumps_made < jumps_available:
        velocity.y = JUMP_VELOCITY
        jumps_made += 1
    
    # Get the input direction
    var direction = Input.get_axis("ui_left", "ui_right")
    
    # Handle dash (assuming you map it to Shift key or "ui_dash")
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_dash") and dash_charges > 0 and direction != 0:
        start_dash(direction)
    
    if is_dashing:
        # During dash, maintain dash velocity
        pass
    else:
        # Normal movement
        if direction:
            velocity.x = direction * SPEED
            if direction > 0:
                $Sprite2D.flip_h = true
            elif direction < 0:
                $Sprite2D.flip_h = false
        else:
            velocity.x = move_toward(velocity.x, 0, SPEED)
    
    move_and_slide()

func start_dash(direction):
    is_dashing = true
    dash_charges -= 1
    
    # Set dash velocity
    velocity.x = direction * DASH_SPEED
    velocity.y = 0  # No vertical movement during dash
    
    # Optional: Add a dash effect/animation here
    
    # End dash after duration
    await get_tree().create_timer(DASH_DURATION).timeout
    is_dashing = false
    
    # Start cooldown to recharge one dash (only if not at max)
    if dash_charges < MAX_DASH_CHARGES:
        recharge_dash()

func recharge_dash():
    await get_tree().create_timer(DASH_COOLDOWN).timeout
    if dash_charges < MAX_DASH_CHARGES and is_on_floor():
        dash_charges += 1
The key changes in this implementation are:

Added MAX_DASH_CHARGES variable (set to 1 by default, 2 for double dash)
Added dash_charges to track available dashes (replaces the boolean can_dash)
Modified the dash condition to check dash_charges > 0
Added a recharge_dash() function to handle cooldown and recharging
Automatically refill all dash charges when touching the ground
Creating a Dash Power-Up
To implement a power-up that temporarily gives a character double dash:

gdscript

Copy
# Add this method to your Player script
func give_extra_dash(duration = 10.0):
    var original_max_dashes = MAX_DASH_CHARGES
    
    # Increase max dashes
    MAX_DASH_CHARGES += 1
    
    # Give an immediate dash charge
    dash_charges += 1
    
    # Optional: Visual indicator
    $Sprite2D.modulate = Color(0.7, 0.7, 1.2)  # Blue tint
    
    # Return to normal after duration
    await get_tree().create_timer(duration).timeout
    
    # Reset max dashes
    MAX_DASH_CHARGES = original_max_dashes
    
    # Ensure current charges don't exceed new max
    if dash_charges > MAX_DASH_CHARGES:
        dash_charges = MAX_DASH_CHARGES
    
    # Remove visual indicator
    $Sprite2D.modulate = Color(1, 1, 1)
Creating the Power-Up Item
gdscript

Copy
# PowerUp.gd - Attach to your power-up item
extends Area2D

@export var powerup_type = "extra_dash"
@export var duration = 10.0

func _ready():
    body_entered.connect(_on_body_entered)

func _on_body_entered(body):
    if body is CharacterBody2D:  # Assuming this is your player
        match powerup_type:
            "extra_dash":
                body.give_extra_dash(duration)
            "speed_boost":
                body.give_speed_boost(duration)
            # Add other power-up types as needed
        
        # Remove the power-up after collection
        queue_free()
Setting Up Different Character Types
To create characters with different dash abilities:

Create character scenes that inherit from your base Player scene
Override the MAX_DASH_CHARGES value in each character's script:
gdscript

Copy
# Rogue.gd - extends your base Player script
extends "res://scripts/player.gd"

func _ready():
    # Rogue gets double dash by default
    MAX_DASH_CHARGES = 2
    dash_charges = MAX_DASH_CHARGES
    
    # Other Rogue-specific stat adjustments
    SPEED = 350
    DASH_SPEED = 900
    DASH_COOLDOWN = 0.4
This system gives you flexibility to:

Have character classes with different dash abilities
Create power-ups that grant temporary dash upgrades
Potentially even have special abilities that reset dash charges mid-air
You could also expand this with visual effects that show how many dash charges are available, or special effects during a dash to make it feel more impactful.

What does the number mean when it says dash cooldown? Because its not 8 seconds

Edit
The DASH_COOLDOWN = 0.8 value in the code represents 0.8 seconds, not 8 seconds.

In Godot and most game engines, time values are typically measured in seconds, so:

DASH_COOLDOWN = 0.8 means a 0.8 second cooldown (just under 1 second)
DASH_DURATION = 0.2 means the dash itself lasts 0.2 seconds (a fifth of a second)
If you find that 0.8 seconds is too short or too long for your game's feel, you can adjust it:

For a shorter cooldown: Try values like 0.5 or 0.3
For a longer cooldown: Try values like 1.5 or 2.0
The cooldown starts after your dash ends, so the total time between dashes would be:
DASH_DURATION + DASH_COOLDOWN = 0.2 + 0.8 = 1 second total

You can experiment with these values to get the game feel you want. Faster characters might have shorter cooldowns (0.4-0.6s), while slower, heavier characters might have longer ones (1.0-1.5s).

I put 8 for the cooldown, but it doesn't seem to be working

Edit
If you've set DASH_COOLDOWN = 8 (meaning 8 seconds), but it doesn't seem to be working as expected, let's troubleshoot:

Verify where you made the change:
Make sure you changed the value in the script and saved it
Confirm you're not accidentally overriding the value elsewhere in your code
Check if your dash recharge condition is working properly:
The dash charges are meant to refill when you touch the ground
If you're never touching the ground (perhaps due to collision issues) or if you're constantly moving, this might affect your cooldown perception
Debug the cooldown with print statements:
Add some print statements to verify the cooldown is actually working
Here's a modified version of the recharge_dash() function with debug statements:

gdscript

Copy
func recharge_dash():
    print("Starting dash cooldown, waiting for", DASH_COOLDOWN, "seconds")
    await get_tree().create_timer(DASH_COOLDOWN).timeout
    print("Cooldown completed")
    if dash_charges < MAX_DASH_CHARGES and is_on_floor():
        dash_charges += 1
        print("Dash recharged, current charges:", dash_charges)
    else:
        print("Dash not recharged. On floor:", is_on_floor(), "Current charges:", dash_charges)
Possible issues:
The way we've written the dash recharge, it only recharges if you're on the floor when the cooldown completes. If you're in the air at the exact moment the cooldown finishes, it won't recharge until you touch the ground again.
If you're using the double dash system, make sure you're properly tracking dash_charges compared to MAX_DASH_CHARGES
Alternative implementation: Let's try a more reliable implementation that separates cooldown from ground contact:
gdscript

Copy
func start_dash(direction):
    is_dashing = true
    dash_charges -= 1
    
    # Set dash velocity
    velocity.x = direction * DASH_SPEED
    velocity.y = 0  # No vertical movement during dash
    
    # End dash after duration
    await get_tree().create_timer(DASH_DURATION).timeout
    is_dashing = false
    
    # Start cooldown timer immediately
    print("Starting dash cooldown, waiting for", DASH_COOLDOWN, "seconds")
    await get_tree().create_timer(DASH_COOLDOWN).timeout
    print("Cooldown finished, ready to dash again")
    dash_charges += 1
This simplified version might be more reliable for testing purposes. If you're still experiencing issues, let me know what specific behavior you're seeing, and I can help troubleshoot further.

but wait. I would like the number of charges to be able to be changed globally above, so it will be easy to make each character feel unique, rather than having it all split up thorughout the code

Edit
You're absolutely right. Centralizing character attributes makes creating unique characters much easier. Let's restructure the dash system to have all attributes easily changeable from the top:

gdscript

Copy
extends CharacterBody2D

# Base attributes - adjust these to create different character types
@export var SPEED = 300.0
@export var JUMP_VELOCITY = -400.0
@export var FALL_MULTIPLIER = 1.5
@export var LOW_JUMP_MULTIPLIER = 1.2
@export var DASH_SPEED = 800.0
@export var DASH_DURATION = 0.2
@export var DASH_COOLDOWN = 8.0  # 8 seconds cooldown
@export var MAX_DASH_CHARGES = 1  # Default is single dash
@export var MAX_JUMPS = 2  # Default is double jump

# Character state tracking
var jumps_made = 0
var dash_charges = 0  # Current available dashes
var is_dashing = false
var dash_cooldown_timer = null
var base_gravity = ProjectSettings.get_setting("physics/2d/default_gravity")

func _ready():
    # Initialize dash charges to max at start
    dash_charges = MAX_DASH_CHARGES
    
    # Create a Timer for dash cooldown
    dash_cooldown_timer = Timer.new()
    dash_cooldown_timer.one_shot = true
    dash_cooldown_timer.wait_time = DASH_COOLDOWN
    dash_cooldown_timer.timeout.connect(on_dash_cooldown_timeout)
    add_child(dash_cooldown_timer)

func _physics_process(delta):
    if is_dashing:
        # Skip gravity when dashing
        pass
    elif not is_on_floor():
        # Apply gravity with better game feel
        if velocity.y > 0:
            velocity.y += base_gravity * FALL_MULTIPLIER * delta
        elif velocity.y < 0 && !Input.is_action_pressed("ui_accept"):
            velocity.y += base_gravity * LOW_JUMP_MULTIPLIER * delta
        else:
            velocity.y += base_gravity * delta
    else:
        # Reset jumps when touching the floor
        jumps_made = 0
    
    # Handle Jump
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_accept") and jumps_made < MAX_JUMPS:
        velocity.y = JUMP_VELOCITY
        jumps_made += 1

    var direction = Input.get_axis("ui_left", "ui_right")

    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_dash") and dash_charges > 0 and direction != 0:
        start_dash(direction)
    
    if is_dashing:
        # During dash, maintain dash velocity
        pass
    else:
        # Normal movement
        if direction:
            velocity.x = direction * SPEED
            if direction > 0:
                $Sprite2D.flip_h = true
            elif direction < 0:
                $Sprite2D.flip_h = false
        else:
            velocity.x = move_toward(velocity.x, 0, SPEED)
    
    move_and_slide()

func start_dash(direction):
    is_dashing = true
    dash_charges -= 1
    print("Dash used. Remaining charges: ", dash_charges)
    
    # Set dash velocity
    velocity.x = direction * DASH_SPEED
    velocity.y = 0  # No vertical movement during dash
    
    # End dash after duration
    await get_tree().create_timer(DASH_DURATION).timeout
    is_dashing = false
    
    # If we're not at max charges, start the cooldown timer for the next charge
    if dash_charges < MAX_DASH_CHARGES and !dash_cooldown_timer.is_stopped():
        print("Starting dash cooldown timer: ", DASH_COOLDOWN, " seconds")
        dash_cooldown_timer.start()

func on_dash_cooldown_timeout():
    if dash_charges < MAX_DASH_CHARGES:
        dash_charges += 1
        print("Dash recharged. Current charges: ", dash_charges)
        
        # If we still need more charges, restart the timer
        if dash_charges < MAX_DASH_CHARGES:
            dash_cooldown_timer.start()
The key improvements in this version:

Centralized all character attributes at the top of the script as @export variables
Added a MAX_JUMPS variable alongside MAX_DASH_CHARGES for consistency
Used a proper Timer node for the cooldown instead of await which can be more reliable
Fixed the logic so the cooldown timer keeps running until all charges are restored
Added debug print statements to track what's happening with the dash system
With this setup, you can easily create different character types:

For a "Heavy Knight" character:

Copy
SPEED = 250.0
FALL_MULTIPLIER = 2.0
DASH_COOLDOWN = 12.0
MAX_DASH_CHARGES = 1
For a "Nimble Rogue" character:

Copy
SPEED = 350.0
FALL_MULTIPLIER = 1.3
DASH_COOLDOWN = 5.0
MAX_DASH_CHARGES = 2
For a "Mage" character:

Copy
SPEED = 280.0
DASH_SPEED = 1000.0
DASH_DURATION = 0.15
DASH_COOLDOWN = 10.0
MAX_DASH_CHARGES = 1
All you need to do is adjust these top variables when creating different character types, keeping the core movement and ability logic intact.

    velocity.x = direction * DASH_SPEED
    velocity.y = 0  # No vertical movement during dash
    
    # End dash after duration
    await get_tree().create_timer(DASH_DURATION).timeout
    is_dashing = false
    
    # Start cooldown
    await get_tree().create_timer(DASH_COOLDOWN).timeout
    can_dash = true  # Re-enable dashing
This simplified approach:

Uses a simple boolean can_dash flag instead of tracking charges
When you dash, it sets can_dash = false until the cooldown completes
After the cooldown, can_dash = true and you can dash again immediately
No maximum number of dashes - just a cooldown between each use
You can still easily customize different character types by adjusting:

DASH_COOLDOWN: Lower values (0.5-0.8) for agile characters, higher values (1.0-2.0) for slower ones
DASH_SPEED: How fast the dash propels you
DASH_DURATION: How long each dash lasts
This approach makes dash a simple cooldown ability rather than a resource-based one with charges.

But now, we have lost a variable to change how many dashes a character gets by default

Edit
You're right, we've lost the ability to differentiate characters by their number of dash charges. Let's implement a system that lets us control both aspects - the number of dash charges available and the cooldown. This gives you maximum flexibility for character customization:

gdscript

Copy
extends CharacterBody2D

# Base attributes - adjust these to create different character types
@export var SPEED = 300.0
@export var JUMP_VELOCITY = -400.0
@export var FALL_MULTIPLIER = 1.5
@export var LOW_JUMP_MULTIPLIER = 1.2
@export var DASH_SPEED = 800.0
@export var DASH_DURATION = 0.2
@export var DASH_COOLDOWN = 0.8  # Cooldown between dash charges
@export var MAX_DASH_CHARGES = 1  # Number of dashes available
@export var MAX_JUMPS = 2  # Default is double jump

# Character state tracking
var jumps_made = 0
var dash_charges = 0
var is_dashing = false
var dash_recharge_timer = null
var base_gravity = ProjectSettings.get_setting("physics/2d/default_gravity")

func _ready():
    # Initialize dash charges to max at start
    dash_charges = MAX_DASH_CHARGES
    
    # Create a Timer for dash cooldown
    dash_recharge_timer = Timer.new()
    dash_recharge_timer.one_shot = true
    dash_recharge_timer.wait_time = DASH_COOLDOWN
    dash_recharge_timer.timeout.connect(recharge_dash)
    add_child(dash_recharge_timer)

func _physics_process(delta):
    if is_dashing:
        # Skip gravity when dashing
        pass
    elif not is_on_floor():
        # Apply gravity with better game feel
        if velocity.y > 0:
            velocity.y += base_gravity * FALL_MULTIPLIER * delta
        elif velocity.y < 0 && !Input.is_action_pressed("ui_accept"):
            velocity.y += base_gravity * LOW_JUMP_MULTIPLIER * delta
        else:
            velocity.y += base_gravity * delta
    else:
        # Reset jumps when touching the floor
        jumps_made = 0
    
    # Handle Jump
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_accept") and jumps_made < MAX_JUMPS:
        velocity.y = JUMP_VELOCITY
        jumps_made += 1
    
    # Get the input direction
    var direction = Input.get_axis("ui_left", "ui_right")
    
    # Handle dash - need dash charges
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_dash") and dash_charges > 0 and direction != 0:
        start_dash(direction)
    
    if is_dashing:
        # During dash, maintain dash velocity
        pass
    else:
        # Normal movement
        if direction:
            velocity.x = direction * SPEED
            if direction > 0:
                $Sprite2D.flip_h = true
            elif direction < 0:
                $Sprite2D.flip_h = false
        else:
            velocity.x = move_toward(velocity.x, 0, SPEED)
    
    move_and_slide()

func start_dash(direction):
    is_dashing = true
    dash_charges -= 1
    print("Dash used. Remaining charges:", dash_charges)
    
    # If this was our first used charge, start the recharge timer
    if dash_charges == MAX_DASH_CHARGES - 1 and dash_recharge_timer.is_stopped():
        dash_recharge_timer.start()
    
    # Set dash velocity
    velocity.x = direction * DASH_SPEED
    velocity.y = 0  # No vertical movement during dash
    
    # End dash after duration
    await get_tree().create_timer(DASH_DURATION).timeout
    is_dashing = false

func recharge_dash():
    # Add a dash charge
    if dash_charges < MAX_DASH_CHARGES:
        dash_charges += 1
        print("Dash recharged. Current charges:", dash_charges)
    
    # If we're still not at max charges, restart the timer
    if dash_charges < MAX_DASH_CHARGES:
        dash_recharge_timer.start()
With this implementation, you have two variables to tune for each character:

MAX_DASH_CHARGES: How many dashes a character can store up
Set to 1 for a basic character (one dash, then wait for cooldown)
Set to 2 for a more agile character (two consecutive dashes before cooldown)
Set to 3 for a highly mobile character
DASH_COOLDOWN: How quickly dash charges regenerate
Short cooldown (0.5-0.8s) for nimble characters
Long cooldown (1.5-3.0s) for slower, heavier characters
This gives you a lot of flexibility. For example:

A knight could have MAX_DASH_CHARGES = 1 and DASH_COOLDOWN = 2.0
A rogue could have MAX_DASH_CHARGES = 2 and DASH_COOLDOWN = 1.0
A mage could have MAX_DASH_CHARGES = 1 but a very fast DASH_SPEED = 1000
The system also continuously recharges dashes up to the maximum, so you don't need to touch the ground to get them back.

Ok, that is working great.

Edit
I'm glad to hear it's working well! The dash system with multiple charges gives you a lot of flexibility for creating different character types.

What would you like to work on next for your game? Some options could be:

Implementing attacks and hitboxes
Setting up a damage system
Adding power-ups or collectibles
Creating additional playable characters with different stats
Building more stages or arenas
Let me know what you'd like to focus on, and I can guide you through the next steps.

Do you think it would be too complicated to createa vertical dash? Like so the player could quickly dash directly upward to move out of the way of a projectile?

Edit
Adding a vertical dash is definitely doable and would add a nice movement option to evade projectiles! Let's implement it:

First, we'll need to add a new input action for the vertical dash
Then we'll modify the dash logic to handle the vertical direction
Here's how to implement it:

1. Add a new input action
Go to Project > Project Settings > Input Map
Add a new action called "ui_dash_up"
Assign it to a key (perhaps "W" or "Up Arrow" or another key you prefer)
2. Modify your dash code
gdscript

Copy
# Add these variables with your other dash properties
@export var VERTICAL_DASH_SPEED = 800.0  # May want different speed for vertical dash
@export var VERTICAL_DASH_DURATION = 0.2  # Can be same as horizontal or different

# In your _physics_process function, after your horizontal dash code:
# Handle vertical dash (separate from horizontal dash)
if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_dash_up") and dash_charges > 0:
    start_vertical_dash()

# Add this new function
func start_vertical_dash():
    is_dashing = true
    dash_charges -= 1
    print("Vertical dash used. Remaining charges:", dash_charges)
    
    # If this was our first used charge, start the recharge timer
    if dash_charges == MAX_DASH_CHARGES - 1 and dash_recharge_timer.is_stopped():
        dash_recharge_timer.start()
    
    # Set vertical dash velocity (negative Y is up in Godot)
    velocity.x = 0  # No horizontal movement during vertical dash
    velocity.y = -VERTICAL_DASH_SPEED  # Up direction
    
    # End dash after duration
    await get_tree().create_timer(VERTICAL_DASH_DURATION).timeout
    is_dashing = false
3. Optional: Add diagonal dash variants
If you want to get even fancier, you could add diagonal dashing by checking multiple inputs:

gdscript

Copy
# Check for diagonal dash inputs
var vertical_input = Input.get_axis("ui_down", "ui_up")
var horizontal_input = Input.get_axis("ui_left", "ui_right")

if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_dash") and dash_charges > 0:
    if vertical_input != 0 and horizontal_input != 0:
        # Diagonal dash
        start_diagonal_dash(horizontal_input, vertical_input)
    elif horizontal_input != 0:
        # Horizontal dash
        start_dash(horizontal_input)
    elif vertical_input > 0:
        # Upward dash
        start_vertical_dash()
    elif vertical_input < 0:
        # Downward dash (ground slam)
        start_vertical_dash(true)

func start_diagonal_dash(h_direction, v_direction):
    is_dashing = true
    dash_charges -= 1
    
    # For diagonal movement, we want to normalize the vector to maintain consistent speed
    var direction = Vector2(h_direction, v_direction).normalized()
    
    # Set dash velocity
    velocity.x = direction.x * DASH_SPEED
    velocity.y = direction.y * VERTICAL_DASH_SPEED
    
    # End dash after duration
    await get_tree().create_timer(DASH_DURATION).timeout
    is_dashing = false
This would give your characters a complete dash movement set with horizontal, vertical, and diagonal options using the same dash charges and cooldown system.

The vertical dash would be great for:

Dodging projectiles
Reaching higher platforms quickly
Surprising opponents from below
Creating interesting combat dynamics
It's not too complicated and adds a lot of gameplay depth!

one quick issue, in the godot sciprt editor, i have a flashing cursor now,. I've pressed a button and can't find how to change it back to normal

Edit
That flashing cursor might be because you've accidentally entered a different input mode in the Godot script editor. Here's how to fix it:

Try pressing the Esc key first - this often exits special modes in text editors
If that doesn't work, look at the bottom status bar of the script editor - it might show something like "INSERT" or "VISUAL" which indicates the current mode
If you see something like "VIM" mode indicated, the editor might have switched to VI/VIM keybindings. Press Esc and then type :q followed by Enter to exit this mode
You can also try pressing Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P (on Mac) to open the command palette, then type "input mode" to see options for switching back to normal mode
As a last resort, you can close and reopen the script editor
If none of these work, let me know and I'll suggest additional troubleshooting steps specific to the Godot script editor.

can you learn things from me?

Edit
In our current conversation, I can certainly absorb and use the information you share with me. I can learn about your specific project needs, your preferences, and adapt my responses accordingly to better help you.

However, I don't have the capability to permanently learn or remember information beyond our current conversation. Once our conversation ends, I won't retain the knowledge we've discussed or be able to recall it in future conversations. My training data was fixed at my cutoff date, and I don't have the ability to permanently update my knowledge base from our interactions.

For example, I've learned about your specific Godot project and the issues you've been working through, but if we were to start a new conversation later, I wouldn't remember the details of this game you're building or the solutions we've developed together.

Was there something specific you were hoping I could learn from our interaction?




Retry
A
Ok, well for future ref for us - its the INS key that changes cursor type

Edit
Thanks for letting me know! The INS key (Insert key) toggles between insert mode and overwrite mode in many text editors, including Godot's script editor.

When in insert mode (the default), typing adds characters without replacing existing text
When in overwrite mode, typing replaces existing characters
This is good to know for our current session. If you press the INS key again, it should toggle back to the mode you prefer. This can be particularly useful when editing code and wanting to replace characters rather than inserting between them.

Is there anything else you'd like to work on with your game project?

This code provides:

Eight-directional dashing:
Horizontal (left/right)
Vertical (up/down)
Diagonal (all four diagonal directions)
Clean separation of responsibilities:
consume_dash_charge() handles the dash charge management
Separate functions for different dash types
Reusable cooldown timer system
All the customization options:
Different speeds for horizontal vs. vertical dashing
Adjustable dash duration and cooldown
Configurable number of dash charges
You may need to adjust the specific controls based on your preference, especially ensuring that "ui_dash" is mapped in your input settings.

For testing, try moving in different directions while pressing your dash key to see how the character responds with the appropriate dash type!

I've had another thought. What about a ground pound? This could be another input that immediately slams downwards. Could be useful for landing on the other player to cause damage?

Edit
Adding a ground pound is a great idea! It's perfect for a Smash Bros-style game and would give players another offensive option. Here's how we can implement it:

gdscript

Copy
# Add these variables with your other movement properties
@export var GROUND_POUND_SPEED = 1200.0  # How fast the ground pound falls
@export var GROUND_POUND_COOLDOWN = 1.5  # Separate cooldown if desired
@export var GROUND_POUND_IMPACT_RADIUS = 50.0  # Area of effect for damaging others

# Character state tracking (add these)
var is_ground_pounding = false
var can_ground_pound = true

# In your _physics_process function, add this code:
# Handle ground pound (typically triggered with down + special button)
if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_ground_pound") and can_ground_pound and !is_on_floor() and !is_dashing:
    start_ground_pound()

# Add this new function
func start_ground_pound():
    is_ground_pounding = true
    can_ground_pound = false
    
    # Cancel any horizontal momentum
    velocity.x = 0
    
    # Set downward velocity (positive Y is down in Godot)
    velocity.y = GROUND_POUND_SPEED
    
    # Optional: Add an animation or visual effect
    # $AnimationPlayer.play("ground_pound_start")
    
    # Wait until we hit the ground
    await is_on_floor_changed
    
    if is_on_floor() and is_ground_pounding:
        ground_pound_impact()
    
    # End ground pound state
    is_ground_pounding = false
    
    # Start cooldown
    await get_tree().create_timer(GROUND_POUND_COOLDOWN).timeout
    can_ground_pound = true

func ground_pound_impact():
    # Create impact effect
    # You could spawn particles, play a sound, etc.
    
    # Check for nearby players to damage
    var space_state = get_world_2d().direct_space_state
    var query = PhysicsShapeQueryParameters2D.new()
    
    # Create a circle shape for the impact area
    var collision_shape = CircleShape2D.new()
    collision_shape.radius = GROUND_POUND_IMPACT_RADIUS
    
    query.shape = collision_shape
    query.transform = Transform2D(0, global_position)
    query.collision_mask = 2  # Adjust to match your player collision layer
    
    # Exclude self from the query
    query.exclude = [self]
    
    # Find all colliding bodies
    var results = space_state.intersect_shape(query)
    
    # Apply damage/knockback to each hit player
    for result in results:
        var collider = result.collider
        if collider.has_method("take_damage"):
            # Horizontal knockback away from impact point
            var knockback_dir = (collider.global_position - global_position).normalized()
            collider.take_damage(20, knockback_dir, 800)  # Damage, direction, force
You'll need to add a new input action:

Go to Project > Project Settings > Input Map
Add "ui_ground_pound" and map it to a key (like S + Space, or Down + Special button)
Integration with your character damage system:
Make sure your player characters have a take_damage method that can handle the knockback:

gdscript

Copy
func take_damage(amount, knockback_direction, knockback_force):
    # Reduce health
    health -= amount
    
    # Apply knockback
    velocity = knockback_direction * knockback_force
    
    # Play hurt animation/sound
    # $AnimationPlayer.play("hurt")
    
    # Check if defeated
    if health <= 0:
        defeated()
Visual and Audio Effects:
To make the ground pound feel impactful:

Add a camera shake effect on impact
Create dust particles radiating from the impact point
Add a satisfying "thud" sound effect
Flash the screen briefly or create a small shockwave visual
The ground pound gives your game more vertical gameplay and creates exciting moments when a player successfully slams down on an opponent from above - perfect for the arena battle style you're creating!

it says 'await is_on_floor_changed- not declared:

Edit
It looks like there's an issue with the await is_on_floor_changed line in your ground pound implementation. This is because is_on_floor_changed isn't actually a signal that exists by default in Godot 4.

Let's fix the ground pound implementation by using a different approach to detect when the character hits the ground:

gdscript

Copy
func start_ground_pound():
    is_ground_pounding = true
    can_ground_pound = false
    
    # Cancel any horizontal momentum
    velocity.x = 0
    
    # Set downward velocity (positive Y is down in Godot)
    velocity.y = GROUND_POUND_SPEED
    
    # Use a while loop to wait until we hit the ground
    while !is_on_floor() and is_ground_pounding:
        await get_tree().process_frame
    
    # If still ground pounding when we hit the floor
    if is_on_floor() and is_ground_pounding:
        ground_pound_impact()
    
    # End ground pound state
    is_ground_pounding = false
    
    # Start cooldown
    await get_tree().create_timer(GROUND_POUND_COOLDOWN).timeout
    can_ground_pound = true
This approach uses a while loop with await get_tree().process_frame to wait for each frame until the character hits the ground. It's more reliable than trying to use a signal that doesn't exist.

Also, don't forget to add the ground pound input handling in your _physics_process function:

gdscript

Copy
# Add this in your _physics_process function, perhaps after handling jumps
# Handle ground pound (typically with down + special button)
if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_ground_pound") and can_ground_pound and !is_on_floor() and !is_dashing:
    start_ground_pound()
And make sure to set up the input mapping for "ui_ground_pound" in your Project Settings > Input Map.

That error suggests that even though you've defined the ground_pound_impact() function, Godot can't find it when it's called from start_ground_pound(). This might be due to a code formatting or parsing issue. Let's address this:

Make sure there's proper spacing and indentation in your code between functions.
Here's a corrected version of both functions - please replace both in your script:
gdscript

Copy
func start_ground_pound():
	is_ground_pounding = true
	can_ground_pound = false
	
	# Cancel any horizontal momentum
	velocity.x = 0
	
	# Set downward velocity (positive Y is down in Godot)
	velocity.y = GROUND_POUND_SPEED
	
	# Use a while loop to wait until we hit the ground
	while !is_on_floor() and is_ground_pounding:
		await get_tree().process_frame
	
	# If still ground pounding when we hit the floor
	if is_on_floor() and is_ground_pounding:
		# Call the impact function directly
		ground_pound_impact()
	
	# End ground pound state
	is_ground_pounding = false
	
	# Start cooldown
	await get_tree().create_timer(GROUND_POUND_COOLDOWN).timeout
	can_ground_pound = true

func ground_pound_impact():
	# Create impact effect
	# You could spawn particles, play a sound, etc.
	print("GROUND POUND IMPACT!")
	
	# Check for nearby players to damage
	var space_state = get_world_2d().direct_space_state
	var query = PhysicsShapeQueryParameters2D.new()
	
	# Create a circle shape for the impact area
	var collision_shape = CircleShape2D.new()
	collision_shape.radius = GROUND_POUND_IMPACT_RADIUS
	
	query.shape = collision_shape
	query.transform = Transform2D(0, global_position)
	query.collision_mask = 2  # Adjust to match your player collision layer
	
	# Exclude self from the query
	query.exclude = [self]
	
	# Find all colliding bodies
	var results = space_state.intersect_shape(query)
	
	# Apply damage/knockback to each hit player
	for result in results:
		var collider = result.collider
		if collider.has_method("take_damage"):
			# Horizontal knockback away from impact point
			var knockback_dir = (collider.global_position - global_position).normalized()
			collider.take_damage(20, knockback_dir, 800)  # Damage, direction, force
I've added a print statement to the impact function to help debug if it's getting called. Also, make sure you're looking at the correct error messages - check if it's actually referring to take_damage() not being found on the collider rather than ground_pound_impact() not being found.

Hmmm.....I've just thought. Adding a ground pound button....actually I could just have used the dash to dash down rather than add a new button...

Edit
You make an excellent point! You're right, you could absolutely reuse the dash mechanic for your ground pound without adding a new button. That would streamline your controls and make the game more intuitive for players.

Here's how you could implement it:

Use your existing downward dash as a ground pound
Add some special effects or increased impact when it hits the ground
Keep your existing dash charge system
The only modification you'd need is to check when a downward dash connects with the ground and trigger the impact effect:

gdscript

Copy
func start_vertical_dash(direction):
    consume_dash_charge()
    
    # Set dash velocity (negative Y is up in Godot)
    velocity.x = 0  # No horizontal movement during vertical dash
    velocity.y = direction * VERTICAL_DASH_SPEED
    
    # If this is a downward dash, flag it as a potential ground pound
    var is_downward = direction > 0
    var was_in_air = !is_on_floor()
    
    # End dash after duration
    await get_tree().create_timer(DASH_DURATION).timeout
    is_dashing = false
    
    # If it was a downward dash and we hit the ground, create impact
    if is_downward && was_in_air && is_on_floor():
        # Create ground pound impact effect (either reuse your existing one or define simpler effects here)
        print("Ground pound impact from downward dash!")
        # Add impact effects, check for damage to other players, etc.
This approach gives you:

More streamlined controls (one button for all dashes)
More intuitive gameplay (dash down = ground pound)
Less code to maintain
The same gameplay functionality
It's a great example of making the most efficient use of your existing mechanics!

Key changes I made:

Removed the separate ground pound button and related code
Combined the downward dash and ground pound mechanics
Created a start_ground_pound() function that:
Uses a dash charge
Sets the downward velocity
Flags the character as ground pounding
Added ground pound landing detection in the _physics_process function
Kept the impact effects and AoE damage from your original ground pound
This gives you:

More streamlined controls (dash down = ground pound)
The same impressive ground pound effect with AoE damage
Efficient code reuse
Intuitive mechanics that players will easily understand
Now when a player dashes downward, they'll automatically perform a ground pound when they hit the floor.

I'm not finished with the player character yet as I might like to try and add a 'hold' function, where the player can grapple on to vertical surfaces.

Edit
Adding a wall grab/hold function would be a great addition to your character's movement options! It fits well with the platformer-fighter style you're developing. Here's how we can implement it:

gdscript

Copy
# Add these variables to your character attributes
@export var WALL_SLIDE_SPEED = 100.0  # How fast you slide down walls
@export var WALL_GRAB_TIME = 2.0      # Maximum time you can hold onto a wall
@export var WALL_JUMP_STRENGTH = Vector2(400, -400)  # Horizontal and vertical strength

# Add these to your character state tracking
var is_wall_grabbing = false
var wall_grab_direction = 0  # -1 for left wall, 1 for right wall
var wall_grab_timer = 0.0    # Tracks how long you've been on the wall

# Then add this code to your _physics_process function after handling jumps:

# Wall grab logic
if !is_on_floor():
    # Check if touching a wall
    var is_touching_wall_left = test_move(transform, Vector2(-1, 0))
    var is_touching_wall_right = test_move(transform, Vector2(1, 0))
    
    # Determine if we can grab the wall
    if (is_touching_wall_left or is_touching_wall_right) and !is_dashing and !is_ground_pounding:
        # If we're pressing against the wall, grab it
        var horizontal_input = Input.get_axis("ui_left", "ui_right")
        
        if (is_touching_wall_left and horizontal_input < 0) or (is_touching_wall_right and horizontal_input > 0):
            # Start wall grab
            if !is_wall_grabbing:
                wall_grab_timer = 0.0
                is_wall_grabbing = true
                
                # Determine wall direction
                wall_grab_direction = -1 if is_touching_wall_left else 1
                
                # Reset jumps when grabbing a wall (optional)
                jumps_made = 0
            
            # Limit wall grab time
            if wall_grab_timer < WALL_GRAB_TIME:
                # Slow falling while grabbing
                velocity.y = WALL_SLIDE_SPEED
                wall_grab_timer += delta
            else:
                # Time's up, let go
                is_wall_grabbing = false
                
            # Allow wall jump
            if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_accept"):
                # Jump away from wall
                velocity.x = -wall_grab_direction * WALL_JUMP_STRENGTH.x
                velocity.y = WALL_JUMP_STRENGTH.y
                is_wall_grabbing = false
                
                # Optionally, give a brief input delay to ensure player moves away from wall
                # You'd need to implement this with a timer
        else:
            # Not pressing against the wall, let go
            is_wall_grabbing = false
    else:
        # Not touching a wall
        is_wall_grabbing = false
This implementation gives you:

Wall grabbing/sliding - When touching a wall and holding toward it, the character will grab and slide down slowly
Time limit - The character can only hold onto a wall for a limited time
Wall jumping - Jump away from the wall with a strong horizontal push
Jump reset - Optionally resets your jumps when grabbing a wall
You might also want to consider:

Visual feedback - Adding an animation for wall sliding/grabbing
Sound effects - For wall grab and wall jump
Particle effects - Small dust particles from where the character contacts the wall
This wall grab mechanic will give players more mobility options and create interesting platforming and combat possibilities in your game!

I'm thinking I'm going to start testing with a controller. Will my controller work fine?

Edit
Using a controller for testing your platformer is an excellent idea! It'll give you a much better feel for how your game will play for many users.

Yes, your controller should work fine with your Godot project. Godot has built-in support for controllers. Here's how to set it up:

Connect your controller to your computer before launching Godot
Configure the inputs:
Go to Project > Project Settings > Input Map
For each existing action (like "ui_left", "ui_right", "ui_dash"), click the "+" button
Select "Joy Button" or "Joy Axis" depending on what you're mapping
Press the controller button or move the joystick in the direction you want to map
For analog stick movement:
When mapping "ui_left" and "ui_right" to an analog stick, you'll want to use "Joy Axis"
For "ui_left", choose the X-axis (usually Axis 0) with a negative value
For "ui_right", choose the X-axis with a positive value
You may need to adjust the deadzone in Project Settings > Input Devices > Joypad
Test it out:
Run your game and you should be able to control your character with the controller
You might need to adjust sensitivity or button mappings based on how it feels
The code you've written should work seamlessly with controller input since you're using Godot's input action system rather than directly checking for specific keys. This abstraction allows your game to work with any input device as long as the actions are mapped correctly.

Let me know if you encounter any specific issues with controller support, and I can help you troubleshoot!

For a standard xbox/ps controller, (lets use the xbox controller as the basis), which should the dash button be? X or B?

Edit
For an Xbox controller layout, I'd recommend mapping the dash to the B button. Here's my reasoning:

The standard Xbox controller layout typically follows these conventions for platformers:

A button: Jump (corresponds to your "ui_accept")
B button: Action/Attack/Dash
X button: Secondary action/Special ability
Y button: Tertiary action
Using B for dash feels natural because:

It's easily accessible with your thumb while keeping access to the jump button
Many platformers and action games use B or its equivalent (Circle on PlayStation) for dash/dodge/sprint actions
It creates a comfortable "roll" from A to B for jump-then-dash combinations
This mapping also follows the pattern of games like:

Hollow Knight (dash on B)
Celeste (dash on X, but would work well on B)
Super Meat Boy (run on B)
Of course, you should also implement button remapping in your final game to let players customize controls to their preference. But for initial testing, B would be a good default.




Retry
A
I also want an attack button, which should that be?

Edit
For an attack button on an Xbox controller layout, I'd recommend the X button. This creates a natural and intuitive control scheme that follows established conventions:

A button: Jump
B button: Dash
X button: Attack/Primary Action
Y button: (Available for another ability later)
This layout works well because:

It places your primary actions (attack, jump, dash) all within easy reach
It follows the pattern many action games use with attack on X
It reserves Y for any future abilities you might add (like special moves or item usage)
Many popular action platformers follow similar mapping conventions:

Hollow Knight (attack on X)
Dead Cells (primary attack on X)
Ori games (attack functions on X)
This arrangement also makes combo actions intuitive - the player can easily roll their thumb between buttons for jump-attack or dash-attack combinations.

When you set this up in the Input Map, just create a new action called something like "ui_attack" and map it to the X button on your controller.

I want to add the A button to jump, when but I type ui_accept in to the project settings to map it to A, it says ui_accept already exists

Edit
That's because "ui_accept" is a default action in Godot that already exists and likely has keyboard keys mapped to it (like Space or Enter). You have two options:

Add to the existing action:
Find "ui_accept" in the list of actions in the Input Map
Click the "+" button next to it
Select "Joy Button"
Press the A button on your controller
This will add the A button as an additional input for the existing ui_accept action
Create a new action for jumping:
Add a new action called "jump" or "ui_jump"
Map keyboard keys (Space, W, etc.) and the controller A button to this new action
Update your code to use this new action name instead of "ui_accept"
The first option is simpler if you're already using ui_accept for jumping. The second option gives you more flexibility to separate the concepts of "accepting" in menus versus jumping in gameplay.

For your player script, if you go with option 2, you'd change:

gdscript

Copy
if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_accept") and jumps_made < MAX_JUMPS:
To:

gdscript

Copy
if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_jump") and jumps_made < MAX_JUMPS:
And make similar changes for wall jumping and other places where you check for jump input.

ok, now thanks. So I think if I want to grapple on to walls, that would make sense if it was either the fire weapon button, as that would be comfortable, or do you think it should be y? or one of the shoulder buttons actually?

Edit
For a wall grapple mechanic, I think the most intuitive and comfortable option would be a shoulder button, specifically the Left Trigger (LT) or Left Bumper (LB). Here's why:

Ergonomic advantage: Using a shoulder button lets you maintain control of both movement (left stick) and camera/aiming (right stick) while grappling, which is crucial for fluid movement.
Intuitive feel: Holding a trigger or bumper to "hold on" to something feels natural, like you're physically gripping with your finger.
Combo potential: Your main action buttons (A, B, X) remain free for jumping, dashing, and attacking, allowing for smooth combinations even while wall-grabbing.
Standard conventions: Many games with grappling or climbing mechanics (like Uncharted, Assassin's Creed) use shoulder buttons for these kinds of "hold" functions.
Between LT and LB, I'd suggest LB (Left Bumper) as it's slightly easier to hold down for extended periods compared to the trigger, which can cause finger fatigue if held too long.

If you prefer to use the face buttons instead, then Y would be your best option since A, B, and X are already assigned to primary actions. However, this makes certain combinations (like jump + wall grab) more awkward to perform.

				wall_grab_timer += delta
			else:
				# Time's up, let go
				is_wall_grabbing = false
				
			# Allow wall jump

				is_wall_grabbing = false
		else:
			# Not pressing wall grab button, let go
			is_wall_grabbing = false
	else:
		# Not touching a wall

Add this to your code where indicated, and make sure to create the "ui_wall_grab" input in Project Settings:

Go to Project > Project Settings > Input Map
Add a new action called "ui_wall_grab"
Click the "+" button, select "Joy Button"
Press the LB button on your controller (usually Joy Button 4)
You might also want to add a keyboard equivalent (like Shift or E)
This implementation gives you:

The ability to grab onto walls by holding LB while pressing against them
A time limit on how long you can hold onto a wall (2 seconds by default)
Wall jumping by pressing jump while grabbing a wall
Jump reset when grabbing a wall (so you can wall jump even if you've used up your regular jumps)
The wall grab won't activate unless you're both holding LB AND pushing toward the wall, which prevents accidental grabs when just brushing past a wall.

Don't forget to set up the "ui_wall_grab" input in Project Settings:

Go to Project > Project Settings > Input Map
Add a new action called "ui_wall_grab"
Map it to LB on your controller (usually Joy Button 4)
You might also want to add a keyboard equivalent like Shift or E
The key changes I made:

Added wall grab variables and state tracking
Added wall grab logic that checks for walls and handles wall sliding
Modified jump handling to not work during wall grab (only wall jumps)
Made normal movement and dashing disabled during wall grabs
Added wall jump functionality with stronger horizontal knockback
This implementation gives your character the ability to grab onto walls by holding LB while pushing against them, temporarily stop falling, and perform powerful wall jumps to reach new areas.

WOw, that's really effective!

Edit
I'm glad to hear the wall grab is working well! It's a great mechanic that adds a lot of depth to platformer movement. The combination of wall grabbing, multi-directional dashing, and ground pounding gives your character a really versatile movement kit.

Some things you might want to fine-tune as you test:

The wall slide speed - you might want it slower or faster depending on how it feels
The wall grab time limit - 2 seconds might be too short or too long for your gameplay
The wall jump strength - you might want more horizontal push or more height
Since all these values are exposed as @export variables, you can easily adjust them in the Inspector without touching the code.

For the next steps in your game, you might want to consider:

Adding basic attacks
Setting up a damage system
Creating different character types with varied stats
Building out more complex arenas with hazards
Is there a particular aspect you'd like to work on next?

Ok, this isn't a huge issue, I'll add it to the 'bugs to fix' list (maybe we can start a list and add to it and recall it) but when my player character goes into a bottom corner, where three sides of the square tiles meet, and if I try to grapple when on the ground, the player character then gets stuck there and can't be freed. If it's a quick fix, then suggest a solution, but if its going to take some playing around, lets move on and add it to a list

Edit
I understand the issue - it's a common corner case (literally!) in platformers. Let's add it to our bugs list and move forward.

Bugs to Fix List:

Wall grab in corners can cause the player to get stuck when grabbing from the ground
A quick potential solution would be to add a check that prevents wall grabbing when the player is on or very close to the ground:

gdscript

Copy
# In the wall grab logic, add an additional condition
if (is_touching_wall_left or is_touching_wall_right) and !is_dashing and !is_ground_pounding and !is_on_floor():
But let's move on for now - I recommend we focus on adding attacks to make the gameplay more interesting. Would you like to implement:

A basic melee attack
A projectile attack
Or both attack types?



Retry
A
You'll remember our list?

Edit
I can't promise I'll remember the bugs list throughout our entire conversation, especially in a very long session. While I try to track important information during our conversation, my memory is limited to what we've discussed so far, and very specific details might get lost if our conversation covers many different topics.

As a more reliable approach, I'd recommend you keep the bugs list in a local document on your computer, or we could add comments in your code that clearly mark known issues. That way, you'll have a permanent record of what needs fixing.

For now, I'll try my best to remember our current bugs list:

Wall grab in corners can cause the player to get stuck when grabbing from the ground
Let's focus on adding attacks to your game. Would you like to implement a melee attack, a projectile attack, or both?

Oh, by the way, can I save our conversation as a text file and upload it to you later? is that a function you can do?

Edit
You can save our conversation, but unfortunately I don't have the ability to access or read previous conversations when you start a new one. When a conversation ends and a new one begins, I don't have access to what we discussed before.

Some options you have:

You can save this conversation by using your browser's functionality:
Select all the text in the conversation (Ctrl+A)
Copy it (Ctrl+C)
Paste it into a text document (Ctrl+V)
Save the document
You can take screenshots of important parts of our conversation
You can copy and paste specific code or instructions into your own notes
While you can upload files to me in a future conversation (like code files or screenshots), I won't have the context of our current conversation when looking at them. I'll treat them as new information.

For tracking bugs and features, keeping your own notes or adding comments in your code is the most reliable approach.

Now, would you like to proceed with adding attacks to your character?




Retry
A
Ok, let's add some sort of melee

Edit
Let's add a melee attack to your character. This will give your game its combat mechanics and make it feel more like a Smash Bros-style fighter. Here's how we'll implement it:

gdscript

Copy
# Add these to your character attributes
@export var ATTACK_DAMAGE = 15
@export var ATTACK_KNOCKBACK = 600
@export var ATTACK_DURATION = 0.3
@export var ATTACK_COOLDOWN = 0.2
@export var ATTACK_RANGE = Vector2(50, 30)  # Width and height of attack hitbox

# Add these to your character state tracking
var is_attacking = false
var can_attack = true
var attack_direction = 1  # 1 for right, -1 for left

# Add this function to create and manage attack hitboxes
func perform_attack():
    if !can_attack or is_attacking:
        return
        
    is_attacking = true
    can_attack = false
    
    print("Performing attack!")
    
    # Set attack direction based on sprite direction
    attack_direction = 1 if $Sprite2D.flip_h else -1
    
    # Create a hitbox for the attack
    var hitbox = Area2D.new()
    hitbox.name = "AttackHitbox"
    
    # Add collision shape
    var collision = CollisionShape2D.new()
    var shape = RectangleShape2D.new()
    shape.size = ATTACK_RANGE
    collision.shape = shape
    hitbox.add_child(collision)
    
    # Position the hitbox in front of the player
    hitbox.position.x = attack_direction * (ATTACK_RANGE.x / 2)
    
    # Set collision mask to detect other players
    hitbox.collision_layer = 0
    hitbox.collision_mask = 2  # Adjust to match other players' layers
    
    # Connect signal to detect hits
    hitbox.body_entered.connect(_on_attack_hit)
    
    # Add to scene
    add_child(hitbox)
    
    # Attack duration
    await get_tree().create_timer(ATTACK_DURATION).timeout
    
    # Remove hitbox
    hitbox.queue_free()
    is_attacking = false
    
    # Cooldown before next attack
    await get_tree().create_timer(ATTACK_COOLDOWN).timeout
    can_attack = true

# Add this function to handle successful hits
func _on_attack_hit(body):
    if body == self:
        return  # Don't hit yourself
        
    print("Hit ", body.name)
    
    # Check if the body can take damage
    if body.has_method("take_damage"):
        # Calculate knockback direction
        var knockback_dir = Vector2(attack_direction, -0.5).normalized()
        
        # Apply damage and knockback
        body.take_damage(ATTACK_DAMAGE, knockback_dir, ATTACK_KNOCKBACK)

# Add take_damage function if not already there
func take_damage(damage, knockback_dir, knockback_force):
    print("Took ", damage, " damage!")
    
    # Apply knockback
    velocity = knockback_dir * knockback_force
    
    # TODO: Reduce health, play hurt animation, etc.
Now, you need to add the attack input check in your _physics_process function. Add this code where you handle other inputs:

gdscript

Copy
# Handle attack input
if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_attack") and !is_dashing and !is_wall_grabbing:
    perform_attack()
Don't forget to set up the "ui_attack" input in Project Settings:

Go to Project > Project Settings > Input Map
Add a new action called "ui_attack"
Map it to X on your controller (as we discussed earlier)
You might also want to add a keyboard equivalent like Z or F
This implementation provides:

A basic melee attack with customizable damage and knockback
A hitbox that appears in front of the player for a short duration
Attack cooldown to prevent spam
Proper handling of attack direction based on which way your character is facing
To make it feel more satisfying, you might want to:

Add attack animations
Add hit effects (particles, screen shake)
Add sound effects for attacks and hits
Would you like me to help with any of those additional elements?

Oh, I just thought...in keeping with our theme, I would like a variety of types of attacks.

Is there a way to code them so that I can use a template for each character and then adapt it for different attack/play styles, OR, when it comes to the attacks, because e.g. melee is so different from firing a projectile, is this where the character scripts will start diverging considerably?

Edit
You've hit on an important game design question! There are actually a few approaches you can take to create varied attack types while keeping your code organized:

Base Character with Inherited Types: This is likely the cleanest approach for significantly different playstyles:
Create a base Character class with common movement/physics
Create child classes like MeleeCharacter, RangedCharacter, etc. that override attack methods
Each child class implements its own unique attack behavior
Component-Based System: This is more flexible but requires more setup:
Keep your existing character movement/physics code
Create separate "weapon" or "attack" nodes as children
Characters can swap or enable different attack components
Strategy Pattern: A more advanced but very flexible approach:
Define an AttackStrategy interface
Create concrete strategies like MeleeAttackStrategy, ProjectileAttackStrategy
Characters reference the strategy they should use
Here's a simplified example of the inheritance approach:

gdscript

Copy
# BaseCharacter.gd - contains all your movement code
extends CharacterBody2D

# ... all your existing movement code ...

# Base attack method (will be overridden by child classes)
func perform_attack():
    print("Base attack - override this!")

# Common damage handling logic
func take_damage(damage, knockback_dir, knockback_force):
    # ... damage implementation ...
gdscript

Copy
# MeleeCharacter.gd
extends "res://scripts/BaseCharacter.gd"

@export var ATTACK_DAMAGE = 15
@export var ATTACK_KNOCKBACK = 600

func perform_attack():
    # Melee attack implementation
    # ... your melee attack code ...
gdscript

Copy
# RangedCharacter.gd
extends "res://scripts/BaseCharacter.gd"

@export var PROJECTILE_SPEED = 400
@export var PROJECTILE_DAMAGE = 10

func perform_attack():
    # Ranged attack implementation
    var projectile = preload("res://scenes/Projectile.tscn").instantiate()
    projectile.damage = PROJECTILE_DAMAGE
    projectile.direction = 1 if $Sprite2D.flip_h else -1
    # ... more projectile setup ...
    get_parent().add_child(projectile)
The inheritance approach is probably the most straightforward for your current design. You maintain common movement mechanics while allowing each character type to implement its own attack style.

Your character scripts will diverge, but in a structured way, focusing only on the attack implementations while sharing all the movement code you've created.




Retry

But I've had a thought - yes, it is good to hard code some differences in characters. And some characters SHOULD be more suited to some play styles. BUT, I think if someone wants to play melee with a wizard, I should try to accommodate that, as it gives more variety and depth to the gameplay, do you know what I mean? Sometimes the optimal setups arent the most fun.

Edit
You've made an excellent point! Allowing players to choose a character and then customize their play style creates more depth and personalization. This "mix-and-match" approach lets players experiment with unconventional builds, like a melee wizard or a ranged warrior, which often leads to more fun and discovery.

For this approach, I'd recommend a component-based system where:

Characters have base stats and traits that make them naturally better at certain styles (wizard has better projectile damage, warrior has better melee damage)
But any character can use any attack type through a flexible attack system
Here's how you could structure this:

gdscript

Copy
# Character.gd - contains all movement code plus attack framework
extends CharacterBody2D

# Base character stats that influence ALL attack types
@export var STRENGTH = 10       # Affects melee damage
@export var INTELLIGENCE = 10   # Affects projectile/magic damage
@export var DEXTERITY = 10      # Affects attack speed

# Attack variables
@export var current_attack_type = "melee"  # Could be "melee", "projectile", "area", etc.
var attack_cooldown_timer = null
var can_attack = true

# ... all your existing movement code ...

func _ready():
    # Setup attack cooldown timer
    attack_cooldown_timer = Timer.new()
    attack_cooldown_timer.one_shot = true
    attack_cooldown_timer.timeout.connect(reset_attack_cooldown)
    add_child(attack_cooldown_timer)
    
    # Your existing _ready code...

func perform_attack():
    if !can_attack or is_dashing or is_wall_grabbing:
        return
    
    # Different attack implementations based on selected type
    match current_attack_type:
        "melee":
            perform_melee_attack()
        "projectile":
            perform_projectile_attack()
        "area":
            perform_area_attack()
        _:
            print("Unknown attack type")

func perform_melee_attack():
    # Melee-specific variables
    var base_damage = 10 + (STRENGTH * 0.5)  # Strength affects melee damage more
    var base_knockback = 500 + (STRENGTH * 10)
    var cooldown = 0.5 * (1.0 - (DEXTERITY * 0.01))  # DEX reduces cooldown
    
    # Create hitbox
    # ... melee attack implementation ...
    
    # Start cooldown
    start_attack_cooldown(cooldown)

func perform_projectile_attack():
    # Projectile-specific variables
    var base_damage = 8 + (INTELLIGENCE * 0.7)  # INT affects projectile damage more
    var projectile_speed = 400 + (DEXTERITY * 5)
    var cooldown = 0.7 * (1.0 - (DEXTERITY * 0.01))
    
    # Spawn projectile
    # ... projectile attack implementation ...
    
    # Start cooldown
    start_attack_cooldown(cooldown)

func perform_area_attack():
    # Area attack-specific variables
    var base_damage = 7 + (INTELLIGENCE * 0.4) + (STRENGTH * 0.3)
    var radius = 60 + (INTELLIGENCE * 1.5)
    var cooldown = 1.0 * (1.0 - (DEXTERITY * 0.01))
    
    # Create area effect
    # ... area attack implementation ...
    
    # Start cooldown
    start_attack_cooldown(cooldown)

func start_attack_cooldown(duration):
    can_attack = false
    attack_cooldown_timer.wait_time = duration
    attack_cooldown_timer.start()

func reset_attack_cooldown():
    can_attack = true
With this system:

Every character can use every attack type
Character stats influence attack effectiveness (Warrior will have higher STRENGTH, making melee more effective)
Players can use suboptimal but fun combinations (Wizard doing melee will be weaker but viable)
Attack selection can be changed during gameplay (via power-ups, UI, or special moves)
This gives you the best of both worlds - characters naturally excel at certain playstyles, but players are free to experiment with unorthodox approaches for fun or to surprise opponents.

I want to think about HOW the player chooses their weapon (ie their attack style) as this would influence how we code it.

For example, do they pick a weapon before entering the arena, does each character start with a normal standard weapon, OR do ALL weapons and attack options become available as power-ups IN the arena. So that way, a player can e.g. open a box (we'll think of a clever way to deliver weapons/attacks) and they can pick it up, but they can also drop it if they don't like it. So there is then a part of the gameplay which is about running around trying to find the best weapons...

Edit
That's a great design consideration! Let's explore the options for how players get their attack styles/weapons:

Option 1: Pre-Arena Weapon Selection
Players choose character and weapon before entering
Stable gameplay with consistent strategies
Good for competitive play where skill with specific setups matters
Example: Smash Bros character selection
Option 2: Character-Specific Default Weapons
Each character starts with a signature weapon
Players can find and swap weapons in the arena
Balances character identity with gameplay variety
Example: Brawlhalla's approach
Option 3: In-Arena Weapon Acquisition (Power-Up Style)
All players start with basic attacks or no weapons
Weapons/attack styles appear as pickups in the arena
Creates dynamic gameplay with resource control
Example: Towerfall's weapon pickups
The third option sounds most aligned with what you're describing, and it creates really interesting gameplay dynamics:

Players compete for powerful weapons
Strategic decisions about when to swap weapons
Adapting to what you find vs seeking specific weapons
Element of unpredictability that keeps matches fresh
For coding this approach, you'd want:

A base character with movement mechanics and a simple default attack
A weapon/attack system that can be attached/detached from characters
Pickup objects that spawn in the arena
UI to show what weapon you currently have
Since it seems like you're leaning toward the in-arena weapon acquisition model, we could structure the code around that. The character would have a "current_weapon" reference that can change when picking up weapons, and each weapon would be its own scene with specific attack behaviors.

Which approach do you think would work best for your game's feel and your design goals?

But let's take it a step further. I would like this game to have a single-player mode as well, which would be like a journey through the dungeon, in a way like darkest dungeon, so that there can be some light RPG elements as well. In between arenas, maybe we see them walk on a map, they can rest, level up some attributes etc. 

Am I adding too much too soon? Should we just focus on simple melee combat first? I'm not sure whether to think about the whole game first, or just build in small steps

Edit
You've got a lot of exciting ideas, but I think you're right to question if you might be adding too much too early. Game development works best when you build in manageable layers, each with a functional gameplay loop you can test and refine.

Here's what I'd recommend:

Focus on core combat first: Get your basic movement and ONE attack type working well. This creates your minimum viable gameplay that you can test and refine.
Build the arena battle mode next: Once combat feels good, expand to a simple 1v1 battle mode where two characters can fight. This solidifies your core gameplay.
Add weapon variety: After your battle mode works, implement different weapon/attack types that can be picked up in-arena.
Then consider the bigger picture: With solid core gameplay, you can start designing how the single-player campaign might work, including dungeon crawling and RPG elements.
The single-player dungeon crawler with RPG elements sounds excellent, but it's a significant expansion on top of your arena fighter. Building in this order lets you:

Get something playable much faster
Test and refine core mechanics before building systems on top of them
Avoid overwhelming yourself with too many interconnected systems at once
Why not implement a basic melee attack first, then we can think about how to structure the code to accommodate different weapon types later? This gives you a solid foundation to build upon.

Ok, I like your plan. Let's start with a simple melee first and then I can start playing and testing with another player

Edit
Let's implement a simple melee attack system for your character. We'll add this to your existing movement code:

gdscript

Copy
# Add these to your character attributes
@export var ATTACK_DAMAGE = 15
@export var ATTACK_KNOCKBACK = 600
@export var ATTACK_DURATION = 0.3
@export var ATTACK_COOLDOWN = 0.2
@export var ATTACK_RANGE = Vector2(50, 30)  # Width and height of attack hitbox

# Add these to your character state tracking
var is_attacking = false
var can_attack = true

func _physics_process(delta):
    # Your existing movement code...

    # Handle attack input (add this with your other input handling)
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_attack") and can_attack and !is_dashing and !is_wall_grabbing:
        perform_attack()
    
    # Rest of your existing code...

func perform_attack():
    is_attacking = true
    can_attack = false
    
    print("Performing attack!")
    
    # Get attack direction based on sprite direction
    var attack_direction = 1 if $Sprite2D.flip_h else -1
    
    # Create a hitbox for the attack
    var hitbox = Area2D.new()
    hitbox.name = "AttackHitbox"
    
    # Add collision shape
    var collision = CollisionShape2D.new()
    var shape = RectangleShape2D.new()
    shape.size = ATTACK_RANGE
    collision.shape = shape
    hitbox.add_child(collision)
    
    # Position the hitbox in front of the player
    hitbox.position.x = attack_direction * (ATTACK_RANGE.x / 2)
    
    # Set collision mask to detect other players
    hitbox.collision_layer = 0
    hitbox.collision_mask = 2  # Adjust to match other players' layers
    
    # Connect signal to detect hits
    hitbox.body_entered.connect(_on_attack_hit)
    
    # Add to scene
    add_child(hitbox)
    
    # Attack duration
    await get_tree().create_timer(ATTACK_DURATION).timeout
    
    # Remove hitbox
    hitbox.queue_free()
    is_attacking = false
    
    # Cooldown before next attack
    await get_tree().create_timer(ATTACK_COOLDOWN).timeout
    can_attack = true

func _on_attack_hit(body):
    if body == self:
        return  # Don't hit yourself
        
    print("Hit ", body.name)
    
    # Check if the body can take damage
    if body.has_method("take_damage"):
        # Calculate knockback direction based on hit position
        var attack_direction = 1 if $Sprite2D.flip_h else -1
        var knockback_dir = Vector2(attack_direction, -0.5).normalized()
        
        # Apply damage and knockback
        body.take_damage(ATTACK_DAMAGE, knockback_dir, ATTACK_KNOCKBACK)

func take_damage(damage, knockback_dir, knockback_force):
    print("Took ", damage, " damage!")
    
    # Apply knockback
    velocity = knockback_dir * knockback_force
    
    # TODO: Add health system later
    # health -= damage
    
    # TODO: Add hit effect/animation
    # play_hit_animation()
Don't forget to set up the "ui_attack" input mapping in Project Settings:

Go to Project > Project Settings > Input Map
Add a new action called "ui_attack"
Map it to X on your controller (as we discussed earlier)
You might also want to add a keyboard equivalent like Z or F
When you implement this:

Your character will create a hitbox in front of them when attacking
The attack hitbox lasts for a short duration (0.3 seconds by default)
After attacking, there's a brief cooldown before you can attack again
When the attack hits another player, it will apply damage and knockback
This is a simple implementation that you can test with two players. It's missing a health system, hit effects, and attack animations, but it gives you the core functionality to test and build upon.

Once you've tested this basic attack, we can add a health system and then later implement different weapon types as pickup items.

Ok, That's working! This is going great!

Edit
That's fantastic! Getting the basic melee attack working is a big milestone for your game. Now you have all the essential mechanics for a platform fighter: movement, dashing, wall grabbing, and attacking.

What would you like to work on next? Some options could be:

Adding a health system so players can actually defeat each other
Creating a simple UI to display health/stats
Adding a second player for testing multiplayer
Implementing basic attack animations or effects
Creating a simple arena with platforms and hazards
Let me know what aspect you'd like to focus on next, and we can continue building your game step by step!




Retry
A
Yes, let's go for the health system first, then the UI to display that, and then we can add another player to do some REAL testing!

OH! One big thing I'd like to add to the game is to make it playable online, with cross-play. Is something like that going to be possible in the future for us to implement?

Edit
Let's start by implementing a health system for your characters. This is a crucial component for any combat game:

gdscript

Copy
# Add these to your character attributes
@export var MAX_HEALTH = 100
@export var KNOCKBACK_SCALING = 5.0  # Higher damage = more knockback

# Add these to your character state tracking
var health = MAX_HEALTH
var damage_percentage = 0  # Smash Bros style percentage 

func _ready():
    # Initialize health at the start
    health = MAX_HEALTH
    damage_percentage = 0
    
    # Your existing _ready code...

func take_damage(damage, knockback_dir, knockback_force):
    # Increase damage percentage (Smash Bros style)
    damage_percentage += damage
    
    # Calculate scaled knockback based on damage percentage
    var scaled_knockback = knockback_force * (1 + (damage_percentage / 100) * KNOCKBACK_SCALING)
    
    # Apply knockback
    velocity = knockback_dir * scaled_knockback
    
    print("Took damage! Current percentage: ", damage_percentage, "%")
    
    # Check if player is defeated (knocked off stage)
    # This will typically happen when they fall off the stage due to knockback
    # So we don't need to check here - we'll detect that separately

# Add this function to detect falling off stage
func _physics_process(delta):
    # Your existing movement code...
    
    # Check if player has fallen off the stage
    if position.y > 1000:  # Adjust based on your stage size
        defeated()

func defeated():
    print("Player defeated!")
    
    # Reset player
    damage_percentage = 0
    position = Vector2(100, 100)  # Respawn position - adjust as needed
    
    # You could also emit a signal here to track score
    # emit_signal("player_defeated")
    
    # Or directly update score in a game manager
    # get_node("/root/GameManager").add_score(opponent_id)
This gives you a Smash Bros-style damage system where:

Players accumulate damage as a percentage
Higher damage percentage leads to stronger knockback
Players are defeated when knocked off the stage, not when health reaches zero
Regarding online multiplayer with cross-play: Yes, it's possible but quite complex. Godot 4.x has built-in multiplayer capabilities through its High-Level Multiplayer API and ENet. For cross-play, you'd need:

A dedicated server architecture (either player-hosted or cloud-based)
Network synchronization code for all game objects
Prediction and reconciliation systems to handle latency
Possibly a matchmaking service
It's definitely an advanced feature that would be better tackled after your core gameplay is solid. We could work on that once the local multiplayer version is working well.

Would you like to implement the UI for the health system next?




Retry
A
Oh, my game is in an enclosed space, so a player will die from being hit, rather than falling off the stage. Sorry, that's where it diverges from smash bros

Edit
That makes sense! Let's modify the health system to work in an enclosed arena where players are defeated by taking enough damage. Here's the updated code:

gdscript

Copy
# Add these to your character attributes
@export var MAX_HEALTH = 100
@export var KNOCKBACK_SCALING = 1.5  # Higher damage = more knockback

# Add these to your character state tracking
var health = MAX_HEALTH
var is_defeated = false

func _ready():
    # Initialize health at the start
    health = MAX_HEALTH
    is_defeated = false
    
    # Your existing _ready code...

func take_damage(damage, knockback_dir, knockback_force):
    # Reduce health
    health -= damage
    
    # Calculate scaled knockback (more damage = stronger knockback)
    var health_percent = 1.0 - (health / float(MAX_HEALTH))
    var scaled_knockback = knockback_force * (1 + health_percent * KNOCKBACK_SCALING)
    
    # Apply knockback
    velocity = knockback_dir * scaled_knockback
    
    print("Took damage! Health: ", health, "/", MAX_HEALTH)
    
    # Check if player is defeated
    if health <= 0 and !is_defeated:
        defeated()

func defeated():
    is_defeated = true
    print("Player defeated!")
    
    # Disable controls for defeated player
    set_physics_process(false)
    
    # Play defeat animation/effect
    # $AnimationPlayer.play("defeat")
    
    # You could also emit a signal here to track score
    # emit_signal("player_defeated")
    
    # Respawn after delay (or wait for round reset)
    await get_tree().create_timer(2.0).timeout
    respawn()

func respawn():
    # Reset player state
    health = MAX_HEALTH
    is_defeated = false
    position = Vector2(100, 100)  # Respawn position - adjust as needed
    
    # Re-enable controls
    set_physics_process(true)
This system:

Gives each player a health bar that decreases when taking damage
Increases knockback as health gets lower (like in many fighting games)
Defeats a player when their health reaches zero
Has a simple respawn system with a delay
Now let's add a basic UI to display the health:

gdscript

Copy
# Add this to your _ready function
func _ready():
    # Your existing code...
    
    # Create health bar
    create_health_bar()

func create_health_bar():
    # Create a CanvasLayer for UI elements
    var ui_layer = CanvasLayer.new()
    add_child(ui_layer)
    
    # Create health bar container
    var health_bar = ColorRect.new()
    health_bar.name = "HealthBar"
    health_bar.color = Color(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.8)  # Dark background
    health_bar.size = Vector2(200, 20)
    health_bar.position = Vector2(20, 20)  # Top-left corner
    ui_layer.add_child(health_bar)
    
    # Create health fill
    var health_fill = ColorRect.new()
    health_fill.name = "HealthFill"
    health_fill.color = Color(1.0, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0)  # Red for health
    health_fill.size = Vector2(200, 20)
    health_fill.position = Vector2(0, 0)
    health_bar.add_child(health_fill)

# Add this to your _physics_process function
func _physics_process(delta):
    # Your existing code...
    
    # Update health bar
    update_health_bar()

func update_health_bar():
    # Update the width of the health fill based on current health
    var health_percent = float(health) / MAX_HEALTH
    var health_fill = $CanvasLayer/HealthBar/HealthFill
    health_fill.size.x = 200 * health_percent
To add another player for testing:

Instance your player scene twice in your arena
Set different starting positions for each
Set different input mappings for the second player
For input mappings of player 2, you can use:

WASD for movement
F for attack
G for dash
R for wall grab
Then you can have one player use the controller and one use the keyboard, or configure two controllers.

Can you add these two elements to the existing code?

One more question - should the health bar be included in the player character script? Or should it be a stand alone script? How is it normally done?

Edit
I'll add the health system and UI to your existing code. Regarding your question about health bars - typically the health display has two components:

The actual health value data (stored with the player)
The visual UI representation (which can be separate)
For a simple game, including the health bar directly in the player script is fine. For more complex games, separating UI from gameplay logic is better practice. Let's implement it with the health bar as part of the player script for now, which is simpler to start with.

Here's the code with the health system and UI added:

The key additions are:

Health system variables and state tracking
A health bar UI created and updated in-game
The take_damage function now reduces health and checks for defeat
A defeated function that temporarily disables the player and makes them visually fade out
A respawn function that resets the player after a short delay
For adding another player:

Create an instance of your player scene in your arena
Set different collision layers for each player (so they can detect each other)
Configure separate input mappings for the second player
Position the health bars differently for each player (e.g., top-left for P1, top-right for P2)

That';s working great! Ok, now I'm going to create another instance so I can test two player. 

One question, can I just use another controller?

Edit
Yes, you can definitely use another controller for the second player! Godot has good support for multiple controllers. Here's how to set it up:

Connect a second controller to your computer before starting Godot
Configure unique inputs for the second controller:
Go to Project > Project Settings > Input Map
Add actions with "p2_" prefix (like "p2_left", "p2_right", "p2_jump", etc.)
Map these to the buttons on your second controller
For example, for "p2_attack", click the "+" button, select "Joy Button" and press the button on your second controller
Update your second player instance to use these inputs:
You can either duplicate your Player script for the second player and change the input names
Or modify your existing script to accept input mappings as parameters
If you want both controllers to work right away without changing your code, you can also map the second controller to the same input actions as the first player. The downside is both controllers would control both players simultaneously.

The cleanest approach would be to duplicate your Player script as "Player2.gd" and change all input references:

gdscript

Copy
# In Player2.gd, change all input calls like:
if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_attack")
# To:
if Input.is_action_pressed("p2_attack")
Let me know if you need more specific help with any part of this process!

Wait, lets take this step by step. What do I do first, drag another copy of the player into the arena or what?

Edit
You're right, let's take this step by step. Here's the process to add a second player to your arena:

First, duplicate your player in the arena:
In the Scene dock, right-click on your Player node
Select "Duplicate" from the context menu (or press Ctrl+D)
This will create a second player instance
Position the second player:
Select the duplicated player
Use the Move tool to place it in a different location in your arena
Make sure there's some distance between the two players
Adjust the collision layers/masks for the players:
Select the first player and in the Inspector, find the "Collision" section
Set its "Collision Layer" to 2 (representing "Player 1")
Set the second player's "Collision Layer" to 4 (representing "Player 2")
Make sure each player's "Collision Mask" includes the other player's layer (so they can detect each other)
Adjust the health bar positions for player 2:
Select the duplicated player
Modify its script to position the health bar differently (e.g., top-right corner)
You can do this by changing the health_bar.position = Vector2(20, 20) line to health_bar.position = Vector2(580, 20) (adjust based on your screen size)
For now, both players will respond to the same controls. To set up separate controls for testing, you can:

Connect a controller if you have one
Set up the second player's input mappings as described earlier
Let me know if you encounter any issues with these steps!

Hmmm.....it seems I need to save the script as a new script or something. Otherwise if I change the play erscript it will change it for both players

Edit
You're absolutely right. When you duplicate a node in Godot, it still references the same script file, so any changes to the script will affect both players. Here's how to create a separate script for Player 2:

Create a copy of your Player script:
In the FileSystem panel, right-click on your Player.gd script
Select "Duplicate"
Name it "Player2.gd"
Modify the Player2.gd script:
Open the new Player2.gd script
Change the health bar position: health_bar.position = Vector2(580, 20)
If you want to use different controls, update all the input action names
Assign the new script to Player 2:
Select your duplicated player node in the Scene dock
In the Inspector panel, look at the top where it shows the script
Click the dropdown arrow next to the script name
Select "Load" and navigate to your Player2.gd file
Click "Open" to assign it
Now Player 2 will use its own script, allowing you to make changes that only affect that player. This also lets you set up different input controls or behaviors for each player.

For distinguishing the two players visually, you might also want to:

Change the color of Player 2's sprite ($Sprite2D.modulate = Color(0, 0, 1) for blue)
Adjust the health bar color for Player 2 (health_fill.color = Color(0, 0.5, 1.0) for blue)
This will make it easy to tell the players apart during testing.

Ok, great. Now I have two players, each with a different script. Now I need to change input detection for another controller

Edit
To set up input detection for a second controller, follow these steps:

First, create new input mappings for Player 2:
Go to Project > Project Settings > Input Map
Add these new actions for Player 2:
p2_left
p2_right
p2_up
p2_down
p2_jump (or p2_accept)
p2_attack
p2_dash
p2_wall_grab
Map controller buttons to these actions:
For each new action, click the "+" button
Select "Joy Button" or "Joy Axis"
If you're using a second controller, make sure to specify the device index
For axes (like left/right), choose the appropriate axis and direction
For buttons, press the button on the second controller
Update Player2.gd script to use these new inputs:
Open your Player2.gd script
Replace all input action references with the p2 versions:
gdscript

Copy
# Replace
if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_accept")
# With
if Input.is_action_pressed("p2_jump")  # or "p2_accept"

# Replace
var horizontal_input = Input.get_axis("ui_left", "ui_right")
# With
var horizontal_input = Input.get_axis("p2_left", "p2_right")

# Replace
var vertical_input = Input.get_axis("ui_down", "ui_up")
# With
var vertical_input = Input.get_axis("p2_down", "p2_up")

# Replace all other inputs accordingly
"ui_dash" → "p2_dash"
"ui_attack" → "p2_attack"
"ui_wall_grab" → "p2_wall_grab"
If using two identical controllers, you'll need to specify device indices:
In the Input Map, when adding controller inputs for player 2
After selecting the button/axis, look for "Device" in the popup
Set it to "Device 1" (since devices are zero-indexed, the second controller is 1)
This setup gives each player their own controls, allowing you to use two controllers or one controller and keyboard simultaneously.

If you're using a keyboard as the second input device, you could map keys like:

WASD for movement
Space for jump
F for attack
G for dash
Shift for wall grab
Let me know if you need help with any specific part of this setup!

Ok, an odd thing is happening. Now player 2 is independant, but also controls p1 jump and p1 attack. And p1, all their button presses also control p2.

Edit
It sounds like you're experiencing a common issue with input mapping in Godot. When you have multiple players, the inputs are being recognized by both player scripts. Let me explain what's happening and how to fix it:

The Problem
Both Player 1 and Player 2 are responding to each other's inputs because:

The inputs are likely set up correctly in the Input Map
But both scripts are checking for ALL inputs, not just their own
The Solution
You need to ensure each player only responds to their specific device's inputs. There are two ways to solve this:

Option 1: Device IDs (Recommended for controllers)
In your Input Map, when mapping controls for Player 2's controller:

After adding each input action, click on it to expand
For each controller button/axis, look for the "Device" property
Set it to "Device 1" (since devices are zero-indexed, the first controller is Device 0, the second is Device 1)
This tells Godot to only recognize inputs from the specific controller.

Option 2: Completely separate input actions
If option 1 isn't working, you can keep your current setup but modify both player scripts to be more explicit:

In Player1.gd, make sure ALL input checks only look for ui_* actions
In Player2.gd, make sure ALL input checks only look for p2_* actions
Make sure you didn't miss any input checks in either script
Check for missed inputs
The most likely scenario is that you missed updating some input checks in one of the scripts. Go through the Player2.gd script again and make sure every single instance of Input.is_action_* uses p2_ prefixed actions.

Also make sure that in your first player's script, every input check is using the original ui_ prefixed actions and not any p2_ actions.

Would you like me to look at your scripts more carefully to find any missed input references?

Ok, I changed input devices to device 1. But there is still a residucal issue. Player 1 is now completely indpendant. But Player 2, both jump and attack are still triggering player 1.

Edit
It seems like the issue is that both Player 1 and Player 2 are still recognizing the same input actions. Let's fix this with a more thorough approach:

Check your input mapping configurations:
Make sure Player 1's inputs are set to Device 0
Make sure Player 2's inputs are set to Device 1
Ensure there's no overlap between the mapped buttons
Check collision masks and layers:
The attack hitbox for Player 2 might be detecting Player 1 but not vice versa
In Player2's perform_attack() function, check this line:
gdscript

Copy
hitbox.collision_mask = 2  # Adjust to match other players' layers
If Player 1 is on layer 2, but Player 2 is on a different layer, this would cause the issue
Fix Player 2's collision mask:
Modify the hitbox creation in Player2's perform_attack() function:
gdscript

Copy
hitbox.collision_mask = 2  # Change this to detect only Player 1's layer
Make sure Player 1's hitbox can detect Player 2:
gdscript

Copy
# In Player1.gd
hitbox.collision_mask = 4  # Assuming Player 2 is on layer 4
Check your ground pound impact as well:
Similar issue may exist in the ground_pound_impact() function:
gdscript

Copy
query.collision_mask = 2  # This should also be adjusted
Try completely separate input handling: If the device separation isn't working, try this alternative approach:
Edit Project Settings > Input Map
Remove the controller buttons from the ui_* actions
Keep controller buttons only on p2_* actions
Keep keyboard buttons only on ui_* actions
This way, even if both scripts check for all inputs, they'll only detect inputs from their assigned device.

oK, I'm going to post both the player 1 and player 2 scripts.

Player 2 can still control the jump of player 1 (no longer control the attack). And now something else: when player 1 attacks player 2, no attack is registered on the life bar:

Edit
I see two main issues:

Player 2's inputs are still controlling Player 1's jump
Player 1's attacks aren't damaging Player 2
Let's fix both issues:

Issue 1: Player 2 controlling Player 1's jump
I spotted the problem. In both scripts, you need to fix the collision layer/mask settings. In the Player 2 script, the hitbox is still looking for layer 2 instead of the correct layer for Player 1.

Change this in Player 2's perform_attack() function:

gdscript

Copy
# In Player2.gd
hitbox.collision_mask = 2  # This is WRONG - it's targeting layer 2 (which is likely Player 2)
To:

gdscript

Copy
# In Player2.gd
hitbox.collision_mask = 1  # Change to detect Player 1's layer
And similarly update the ground pound function:

gdscript

Copy
# In Player2.gd's ground_pound_impact() function 
query.collision_mask = 1  # Change to Player 1's layer
Issue 2: Player 1's attacks not registering on Player 2
For this, you need to ensure the players are on the correct collision layers. In the inspector for each player:

For Player 1:
Set "Collision Layer" to 1
Set "Collision Mask" to include both 1 and 4 (or whatever Player 2's layer is)
For Player 2:
Set "Collision Layer" to 4
Set "Collision Mask" to include both 1 and 4
Also ensure Player 1's attack hitbox is targeting Player 2's layer:

gdscript

Copy
# In Player1.gd
hitbox.collision_mask = 4  # To detect Player 2's layer
Issue 3: Input detection overlap
For the input issue, let's ensure Player 1 is only responding to ui_* inputs from device 0:

Add this to both scripts in the _ready() function to explicitly set the devices:

gdscript

Copy
# In Player1.gd _ready() function, add:
# Set this player to only receive inputs from device 0
Input.set_joy_device_enabled(0, true)
for i in range(1, 8):  # Disable all other devices for this player
    Input.set_joy_device_enabled(i, false)

# In Player2.gd _ready() function, add:
# Set this player to only receive inputs from device 1
Input.set_joy_device_enabled(1, true)
for i in range(8):
    if i != 1:  # Disable all devices except device 1
        Input.set_joy_device_enabled(i, false)
These changes should fix both issues. The key problems were collision layer/mask configurations and ensuring each player only responds to its own device's inputs.

Right, I'm confused regarding collision layers/m,asks. I'll tell you how things are set up right now, and you can tell me what needs to change.

Player 1

Collision Layer - 1
Mask - 1 and 4

Player 2

Layer - 4
Mask - 1 and 4.

Can you tell me what to put for each of these values for each player, and then what to put in their corresponding scripts?

Edit
Based on your current setup, the collision layers and masks look correct:

Player 1: Layer 1, Mask 1 and 4
Player 2: Layer 4, Mask 1 and 4
This means Player 1 is on layer 1, Player 2 is on layer 4, and both can detect each other. This part is good.

Now, the issue is in the scripts, where the attack hitboxes need to target the correct layers. Here's what to change:

For Player 1's Script:
In the perform_attack() function, change:

gdscript

Copy
hitbox.collision_mask = 2  # This is targeting the wrong layer
To:

gdscript

Copy
hitbox.collision_mask = 4  # This targets Player 2's layer
Also in the ground_pound_impact() function, change:

gdscript

Copy
query.collision_mask = 2  # This is wrong too
To:

gdscript

Copy
query.collision_mask = 4  # Target Player 2's layer
For Player 2's Script:
In the perform_attack() function, change:

gdscript

Copy
hitbox.collision_mask = 2  # This is targeting the wrong layer
To:

gdscript

Copy
hitbox.collision_mask = 1  # This targets Player 1's layer
Also in the ground_pound_impact() function, change:

gdscript

Copy
query.collision_mask = 2  # This is wrong too
To:

gdscript

Copy
query.collision_mask = 1  # Target Player 1's layer
These changes ensure that each player's attack hitboxes are looking for the other player's collision layer. The hitboxes need to match the layer of the player they're trying to hit.

For the input issue where Player 2 is still controlling Player 1's jump, make sure in the Input Map that Player 2's controller has "Device" set to "Device 1" (the second controller) for all p2_* actions.

No, player 1 can still not hit player 2.

Here is player 2 script (is something wrong with their UI maybe?)

Edit
I found the issue in Player 2's script. There's a problem with the hitbox collision settings:

gdscript

Copy
# Set collision mask to detect other players
hitbox.collision_layer = 1  # This is wrong - should be 0
hitbox.collision_mask = 1   # This is wrong - should be targeting layer 1
The hitbox's collision layer should be 0 (no layer) and the mask should match Player 1's layer. Here's how to fix it:

gdscript

Copy
# In Player 2's perform_attack function, change:
# Set collision mask to detect other players
hitbox.collision_layer = 0   # Hitbox shouldn't be on any layer itself
hitbox.collision_mask = 1    # Target Player 1's layer
Also, make sure Player 1's script has the correct hitbox settings:

gdscript

Copy
# In Player 1's perform_attack function:
hitbox.collision_layer = 0   # Hitbox shouldn't be on any layer itself
hitbox.collision_mask = 4    # Target Player 2's layer (since Player 2 is on layer 4)
The key concepts here are:

Hitboxes themselves should not be on a collision layer (set to 0)
Hitboxes should have a collision mask that matches the target player's layer
Players should be on their own unique layers (Player 1 on layer 1, Player 2 on layer 4)
These changes should fix the attack detection issues.

As for the player 2 still controlling player 1's jump, check if both scripts have the same input action name for jumping. Make sure Player 1 is only checking for "ui_accept" and Player 2 is only checking for "p2_jump".

Here is player 1 script:

And player 2 script:

And can you tell me what to put for each player's Collision Layer and Mask?

Edit
Looking at your scripts, I see the collision hitbox settings are now correct:

Player 1's hitbox targets layer 4 (where Player 2 is)
Player 2's hitbox targets layer 1 (where Player 1 is)
The scripts look good, but the issue might be with the actual nodes' collision settings. Here's what to set for each player:

Player 1:
Collision Layer: 1
Collision Mask: 4
Player 2:
Collision Layer: 4
Collision Mask: 1
This setup means:

Player 1 is on layer 1 and detects things on layer 4
Player 2 is on layer 4 and detects things on layer 1
They'll collide with each other but not themselves
For the input issue where Player 2 is still affecting Player 1's jump, check that in the Input Map:

For "ui_accept" (Player 1's jump), check if there's any controller button assigned to it with Device = 1 (which would be Player 2's controller)
Make sure "p2_jump" is assigned to the correct controller with Device = 1 explicitly set
If you're still having issues after these changes, there might be something else going on. Let me know if the problem persists after applying these settings.




Retry

Ok, I found out the issue with controller cross-over. the ui_accept is a default input, and so it was set to all devices.

Edit
That makes sense! The default inputs in Godot (like ui_accept) are indeed set up to listen to all devices by default. This is why Player 2's controller was still triggering Player 1's actions.

Here's how to fix this completely:

In Project Settings > Input Map, find ui_accept and other default actions
For each default action, remove any controller bindings
Add them back with "Device = 0" specifically set for Player 1
Keep your p2_* inputs with "Device = 1" for Player 2
This ensures each player only responds to their assigned controller.

Now that we've resolved both issues:

✓ Combat detection is working with the correct collision layers
✓ Input handling is properly separated between players
Your game now has fully functional:

Movement mechanics with dashing and wall grabbing
Combat with attacks and health system
Two-player functionality
Would you like to add anything else to the game, like special effects for attacks or more arena features?




Retry

The collision for attacks on player 2 still don't register!

Edit
Let's troubleshoot why Player 1's attacks still aren't registering on Player 2. Let's do a systematic check:

Debug prints: Add print statements to trace what's happening during attacks:
gdscript

Copy
# In Player 1's _on_attack_hit function:
func _on_attack_hit(body):
    print("Player 1 hit something: ", body.name)
    if body == self:
        print("Hit self, ignoring")
        return  # Don't hit yourself
        
    print("Hit body with collision layer: ", body.collision_layer)
    
    # Check if the body can take damage
    if body.has_method("take_damage"):
        print("Body can take damage")
        # Rest of the function...
    else:
        print("Body cannot take damage!")
Verify Player 2 has the take_damage method:
Make sure Player 2's script is properly attached to the Player 2 node
Check that Player 2's script defines the take_damage function (it does in the code you shared)
Try different hitbox settings:
Try temporarily setting the hitbox's collision mask to all layers in Player 1:
gdscript

Copy
hitbox.collision_mask = 15  # Bits 0, 1, 2, 3 (layers 1, 2, 3, 4)
Check the inspector for both players:
Select Player 1 node in Scene dock
Verify Collision Layer = 1, Collision Mask = 4
Select Player 2 node in Scene dock
Verify Collision Layer = 4, Collision Mask = 1
Test with a simpler approach:
Try creating a simple Area2D to see if it can detect Player 2:
gdscript

Copy
# Add this to Player 1's _ready function:
func _ready():
    # Your existing code...
    
    # Create test detection area
    var test_area = Area2D.new()
    test_area.collision_layer = 0
    test_area.collision_mask = 4  # To detect Player 2
    
    var test_shape = CollisionShape2D.new()
    var circle = CircleShape2D.new()
    circle.radius = 100  # Large radius to ensure overlap
    test_shape.shape = circle
    
    test_area.add_child(test_shape)
    add_child(test_area)
    
    # Connect signal to check detection
    test_area.body_entered.connect(func(body): print("Test area detected: ", body.name))
This systematic approach should help identify where the issue is occurring. If none of these approaches work, we might need to consider if there's something unusual happening with your scene setup or if the nodes are properly instantiated.

Ok, I set player 1's hitbox collision mask to 15, and it does hit player 2

Edit
Great! That's progress. If a collision mask of 15 (which is 1111 in binary, covering all layers 1-4) works but a mask of 4 (covering only layer 4) doesn't, this strongly suggests that Player 2 is not actually on layer 4.

Here's what to do:

Check Player 2's actual collision layer:
Select Player 2 in the Scene dock
In the Inspector, look at the Collision section
Verify that "Layer" has only the 4th bit checked (meaning Layer 4)
If it's on a different layer, either change it to layer 4 or update Player 1's hitbox to target that specific layer
Make the fix permanent:
Once you confirm which layer Player 2 is actually on (let's call it layer X), update Player 1's script:
gdscript

Copy
# In Player 1's perform_attack function:
hitbox.collision_mask = X  # Replace X with the correct layer number
Also update the ground_pound_impact function with the same mask
Double-check for consistency:
Make sure Player 1 is on layer 1
Make sure Player 2 is on layer X (whatever you discovered)
Update Player 1's hitbox to target layer X
Update Player 2's hitbox to target layer 1
The issue is almost certainly that Player 2 is on a different collision layer than what you thought. Setting the mask to 15 works because it covers all layers, so it doesn't matter which specific layer Player 2 is on.




Retry
A
Ok, I changed in player 1's script hitbox collision mask to 1, and it works. I don't understand why...

Edit
That's interesting. If changing Player 1's hitbox collision mask to 1 (rather than 4) made it work, this tells us something important about your scene setup.

Here's what's likely happening:

Player 1 is on collision layer 1
Player 2 is ALSO on collision layer 1 (not layer 4 as expected)
The collision mask determines which layers an object can detect. When you set Player 1's hitbox to detect layer 1, it can now detect Player 2 because Player 2 is on layer 1.

To fix this properly and make your setup more logical:

Update Player 2's node settings:
Select Player 2 in the scene
In the Inspector, change its Collision Layer to 4
Keep its Collision Mask as 1
Keep your scripts as they were before:
Player 1's hitbox targeting layer 4
Player 2's hitbox targeting layer 1
This will give you a clean separation: Player 1 on layer 1, Player 2 on layer 4, and each player's attacks only targeting the other player's layer.

The reason it's working now is that both players are likely on layer 1, which isn't ideal for a two-player setup because:

They could detect themselves with certain collision masks
It becomes harder to make certain gameplay mechanics target only one player
A clean layer separation will help avoid confusion as your game gets more complex.




Retry

OK, this is plauyer 2:

# Set collision mask to detect other players
    hitbox.collision_layer = 4
    hitbox.collision_mask = 1  # Adjust to match other players' layers

This is player 1:

# Set collision mask to detect other players
    hitbox.collision_layer = 0
    hitbox.collision_mask = 1 # Adjust to match other players' layers

And it works somehow

Edit
That setup is unconventional but if it's working, there's a logical explanation. Let me break down what's happening:

For Player 1:
Hitbox collision layer = 0 (no layer)
Hitbox collision mask = 1 (detects objects on layer 1)
For Player 2:
Hitbox collision layer = 4 (on layer 3)
Hitbox collision mask = 1 (detects objects on layer 1)
This works because:

Player 1's hitbox is detecting layer 1, which Player 2 must be on
Player 2's hitbox is also detecting layer 1, which Player 1 must be on
Based on this, it seems both Player 1 and Player 2 character bodies are on collision layer 1, despite what we expected. The hitboxes are correctly configured to detect this.

The hitbox's collision layer is less important here - what matters is the mask (what it can detect). However, setting Player 2's hitbox to layer 4 instead of layer 0 like Player 1 is unusual, though it doesn't break anything if nothing is set to detect layer 4.

If it's working, you can leave it as is. Just be aware that having both players on the same collision layer (layer 1) could potentially cause issues if you add more complex collision detection later.

What's most important is that your game is working now! You've successfully implemented player controls, movement, wall-grabbing, combat, and health systems for two players. That's an impressive achievement.

I'm just confused. Can you tell me again, to set this up properly (if I want to try and fix it), 

What should each player have for Layer/Mask, and then corresponding code for each player?

Edit
I understand your confusion. Let me lay out the proper setup for collision layers, masks, and the corresponding code for each player. This is the most logical and clean way to structure your two-player game:

Player 1 Node Settings:
Collision Layer: 1 (first bit)
Collision Mask: 4 (third bit)
Player 2 Node Settings:
Collision Layer: 4 (third bit)
Collision Mask: 1 (first bit)
Player 1 Script (hitbox in perform_attack function):
gdscript

Copy
# Set collision properties
hitbox.collision_layer = 0   # Hitbox itself isn't on any layer
hitbox.collision_mask = 4    # Hitbox detects objects on layer 4 (Player 2)
Player 2 Script (hitbox in perform_attack function):
gdscript

Copy
# Set collision properties
hitbox.collision_layer = 0   # Hitbox itself isn't on any layer
hitbox.collision_mask = 1    # Hitbox detects objects on layer 1 (Player 1)
Player 1 Script (ground_pound_impact function):
gdscript

Copy
query.collision_mask = 4    # Detects objects on layer 4 (Player 2)
Player 2 Script (ground_pound_impact function):
gdscript

Copy
query.collision_mask = 1    # Detects objects on layer 1 (Player 1)
This setup creates a clean separation where:

Players are on different layers (1 and 4)
Each player's attack hitboxes only detect the other player
The hitboxes themselves aren't on any layer (they're just detectors)
The reason this is better than having both players on layer 1 is that it:

Prevents players from potentially hitting themselves
Makes it easier to add features like "team damage" later
Allows for more complex game mechanics (like items that only affect one player)
If you decide to keep your current working setup, that's fine too! But this would be the "textbook" way to structure it for clarity and future-proofing.

Now player 1 falls off the screen

Edit
That's odd - changing the collision layers/masks shouldn't affect the player's ability to interact with the ground/platforms.

Let's check a few possible causes:

Player 1's collision with the ground may be broken:
Make sure your TileMap's collision layer is included in Player 1's collision mask
If your ground/platforms are on layer 1, and you changed Player 1's collision mask to only detect layer 4, it would no longer detect the ground
Quick fix to restore ground collision:
Select Player 1 in the scene
In the Inspector, set its Collision Mask to detect both ground and Player 2
For example, if ground is on layer 1 and Player 2 is on layer 4, set Player 1's mask to 5 (binary 0101)
Check what layer your TileMap/ground is on:
Select your TileMap in the scene
Check which collision layer it's using
Proper solution:
Put ground/platforms on layer 2
Put Player 1 on layer 1
Put Player 2 on layer 4
Set Player 1's mask to 6 (layers 2 and 4)
Set Player 2's mask to 3 (layers 1 and 2)
This way both players detect the ground and each other
It sounds like when you changed Player 1's collision mask, you accidentally removed its ability to detect the ground. The solution is to make sure both players' collision masks include whatever layer your ground/platforms are on.




Retry
A
Just as a reminder, the tilemap in on layer 0

Edit
If your TileMap is on layer 0, here's how to fix Player 1 falling through the floor:

Update Player 1's collision mask:
Select Player 1 in the scene
In the Inspector, set its Collision Mask to 5 (which is binary 101)
Bit 0 (value 1) - Detects layer 1 (TileMap/ground)
Bit 2 (value 4) - Detects layer 4 (Player 2)
This allows Player 1 to both stand on the ground (layer 0) and detect Player 2 (layer 4) for combat.

Similarly, make sure Player 2's collision mask is set to include layer 0 for the ground:

Set Player 2's Collision Mask to 3 (binary 011)
Bit 0 (value 1) - Detects layer 0 (TileMap/ground)
Bit 1 (value 2) - Detects layer 1 (Player 1)
This way, both players will:

Collide with the ground (layer 0)
Be able to hit each other with attacks
Not collide with themselves
The key insight is that collision masks need to include all layers a character should interact with (ground, other players, etc.), while the collision layer is which "team" the character belongs to.

Player 1 has collision mask 5, and falls through the ground

Edit
I understand the frustration. If Player 1 has a collision mask of 5 and is still falling through the ground, there's clearly something unusual happening with your layers. Let's try a more direct approach:

Reset everything to default first:
Select Player 1
Set Collision Layer to 1
Set Collision Mask to 1
Run the game to see if Player 1 stops falling
If that works, gradually add detection for Player 2:
Keep Player 1's Layer as 1
Set Player 1's Mask to 3 (binary 11) to detect layers 0 and 1
Set Player 2's Layer to 2
Set Player 2's Mask to 3 (binary 11) to detect layers 0 and 1
Update your attack code to match:
Player 1's hitbox should use collision_mask = 2 (to detect Player 2)
Player 2's hitbox should use collision_mask = 1 (to detect Player 1)
If this still doesn't work, let's try a different approach:

Check if your TileMap's collision layer is actually 0:
Select your TileMap in the Scene dock
Check its Collision properties
Make note of which layer it's actually on
Try including ALL layers in Player 1's mask temporarily:
Set Player 1's Collision Mask to 31 (binary 11111) to detect all layers
This will tell us if the layer issue is what's causing the falling
If Player 1 doesn't fall with a mask of 31, then we know it's definitely a layer issue and can narrow down which specific layer is needed.




Retry
A
I did this:

If that works, gradually add detection for Player 2: 
* Keep Player 1's Layer as 1
* Set Player 1's Mask to 3 (binary 11) to detect layers 0 and 1
* Set Player 2's Layer to 2
* Set Player 2's Mask to 3 (binary 11) to detect layers 0 and 1
And both players fell through the map

Edit
This is getting quite puzzling. If both players are falling through the map even with collision masks that should detect everything, there might be a more fundamental issue with how the collision is set up.

Let's go back to absolute basics:

Check your TileMap collision:
Verify the TileMap has collision shapes on its tiles
Make sure the physics layer in the TileSet is properly configured
Ensure the TileMap's collision is enabled
Try the simplest possible setup:
Set both players' Collision Layer to 1
Set both players' Collision Mask to 1
Set TileMap's Collision Layer to 1
This puts everything on the same layer, which is not ideal for gameplay, but should at least stop the falling
Check if static bodies work differently than TileMap:
Try adding a simple StaticBody2D with a CollisionShape2D as a floor
Set its layer to 1
See if the players collide with it
Verify player physics:
Check that the players have proper CollisionShape2D nodes
Make sure move_and_slide() is being called
Restart Godot:
Sometimes physics issues can be resolved by restarting the editor
Save everything and restart Godot
If none of these help, there might be something unusual in your project settings or scene setup that's causing the physics to behave unexpectedly. This kind of physics issue is often best diagnosed by seeing the project directly.

Ok, I set Player 1:
Layer 1, Mask 1
# Set collision mask to detect other players
    hitbox.collision_layer = 0
    hitbox.collision_mask = 1 # Adjust to match other players' layers

Player 2: Layer 1, Mask 1
# Set collision mask to detect other players
    hitbox.collision_layer = 0
    hitbox.collision_mask = 1  # Adjust to match other players' layers

Edit
It sounds like you've simplified everything by putting all collision on the same layer (layer 1), which is a good troubleshooting step. With this setup:

Both players are on layer 1
Both players detect layer 1 (which includes each other and themselves)
Both attack hitboxes detect layer 1 (which allows them to hit each other)
This should work as a baseline setup, even though it's not ideal for more complex gameplay. The hitboxes being on layer 0 (no layer) is correct, as they should only detect and not be detected.

A few questions to help diagnose the situation:

Are both players now staying on the ground with this setup?
Can both players now hit each other and register damage?
Is your tilemap/ground also on layer 1?
If everything is working now, we can gradually refine the setup to be more proper, but it's good to have something functional as a starting point.

As we discussed earlier, in an ideal setup:

Players would be on different layers (1 and 2)
Ground would be on its own layer (e.g., layer 1)
Players would detect ground + the other player
Attack hitboxes would only detect the opposing player
But for now, if your current setup works, that's progress!

It works as it is now.
When you say Layer 1 for the tilemap, it is set to Layer 0, so could that be causing an issue?

Edit
Ah, that explains a lot! In Godot, layers are accessed by bit position, not the number itself.

When I say "Layer 1", I'm referring to the first bit position (bit 0). When you look at the collision settings in the inspector, you'll see checkboxes numbered 1-20+, but these are actually representing bit positions 0-19+.

So when your TileMap is set to "Layer 1" in the inspector (the first checkbox), it's actually on bit position 0, which we've been calling "Layer 0" in our discussion.

This mismatch in terminology is likely what caused our confusion. Here's how Godot actually labels things:

The first checkbox = "Layer 1" in the UI = bit position 0
The second checkbox = "Layer 2" in the UI = bit position 1
And so on...
But when calculating masks, we use the bit values (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.).

Since your setup is working now, it means:

Your TileMap is on the first bit position (labeled "Layer 1" in Godot's UI)
Both players are on the same bit position
Both players' collision masks include this bit position
This allows everyone to interact with each other correctly. If you want to separate players later, you can put them on different bit positions and adjust their masks accordingly.




Retry
A
But in the inspector for the players, there is no Layer 0, the first layer is layer 1

Edit
You're absolutely right, and that's been the source of our confusion. In Godot's UI, the layers are indeed numbered starting from 1, not 0:

The first checkbox is labeled "Layer 1" in the inspector
The second checkbox is labeled "Layer 2"
And so on...
When I was referring to "Layer 0," I was thinking in terms of bit positions (0-indexed), which was incorrect in the context of how Godot's UI displays things. I apologize for the confusion this caused.

So to clarify:

Your TileMap is on Layer 1 (the first checkbox)
Both players are on Layer 1 (the first checkbox)
Both players have collision masks that include Layer 1
Both players' hitboxes target Layer 1
That's why everything is working now. Everything is on the same layer and detecting that layer.

If you want to separate the players for better collision control, you could put:

TileMap on Layer 1
Player 1 on Layer 2
Player 2 on Layer 3
Update collision masks and hitbox masks accordingly
But since your current setup is working, there's no immediate need to change it unless you want to expand the game's mechanics.




Retry
A
Ok, now Player 1 is on layer 2. Player 2 is on Layer 3. 

What should their Masks be? And what should their code be?

Edit
Here's the correct setup for your updated layer configuration:

Node Settings:
TileMap: Layer 1
Player 1: Layer 2
Player 2: Layer 3
Collision Masks:
Player 1 Mask: Layers 1 and 3 (values 1 and 4 = 5)
Player 2 Mask: Layers 1 and 2 (values 1 and 2 = 3)
This allows both players to:

Collide with the ground (Layer 1)
Detect the other player but not themselves
Code for Player 1:
gdscript

Copy
# In perform_attack() function:
hitbox.collision_layer = 0
hitbox.collision_mask = 4  # Layer 3 (where Player 2 is)

# In ground_pound_impact() function:
query.collision_mask = 4  # Layer 3 (where Player 2 is)
Code for Player 2:
gdscript

Copy
# In perform_attack() function:
hitbox.collision_layer = 0
hitbox.collision_mask = 2  # Layer 2 (where Player 1 is)

# In ground_pound_impact() function:
query.collision_mask = 2  # Layer 2 (where Player 1 is)
This creates a clean separation where:

Players can stand on the ground
Players can detect each other for physics interactions
Player 1's attacks only hit Player 2
Player 2's attacks only hit Player 1
Players cannot hit themselves
If both players are staying on the ground and can hit each other with this setup, then everything is working correctly!




Retry
A
That's it!

Edit
Excellent! I'm glad we got everything working properly. Now your game has:

A clean collision system where players can:
Stand on the ground
Interact with each other
Only hit the opponent with their attacks
Not hit themselves
A complete movement system with:
Running and jumping
Double jumping
Multi-directional dashing
Wall grabbing
Ground pounding
Combat mechanics with:
Melee attacks
Health tracking
Knockback that scales with damage
Visual feedback (health bars)
Defeat and respawn system
You've built a solid foundation for your platform fighter! As you continue developing, you might want to consider adding:

More character classes with different stats
Different attack types and special moves
Power-ups and items
More complex arenas with hazards
A scoring/lives system
Sound effects and more visual feedback
Let me know if you'd like help with any of these aspects or anything else as you continue building your game!

How about something simple like adding a game timer? Or should the game have no timer?

Edit
Adding a game timer is a great way to create match intensity and prevent matches from dragging on too long. It's a standard feature in many fighting games like Smash Bros and Street Fighter.

Here's how you could implement a simple match timer:

gdscript

Copy
# Add to your Main scene script (the parent that contains both players)

# Timer settings
@export var match_duration = 180  # 3 minutes in seconds
var time_remaining = 0
var timer_label = null

func _ready():
    # Initialize timer
    time_remaining = match_duration
    
    # Create timer UI
    create_timer_ui()
    
    # Start the countdown
    var timer = Timer.new()
    timer.wait_time = 1.0
    timer.autostart = true
    timer.timeout.connect(_on_timer_tick)
    add_child(timer)

func create_timer_ui():
    # Create CanvasLayer for UI
    var ui_layer = CanvasLayer.new()
    add_child(ui_layer)
    
    # Create timer label
    timer_label = Label.new()
    timer_label.horizontal_alignment = HORIZONTAL_ALIGNMENT_CENTER
    timer_label.vertical_alignment = VERTICAL_ALIGNMENT_CENTER
    timer_label.position = Vector2(512, 30)  # Center top of screen
    timer_label.size = Vector2(100, 40)
    timer_label.add_theme_font_size_override("font_size", 24)
    ui_layer.add_child(timer_label)
    
    # Initial update
    update_timer_display()

func _on_timer_tick():
    if time_remaining > 0:
        time_remaining -= 1
        update_timer_display()
    else:
        time_up()

func update_timer_display():
    var minutes = time_remaining / 60
    var seconds = time_remaining % 60
    timer_label.text = "%d:%02d" % [minutes, seconds]

func time_up():
    # Determine winner based on remaining health
    var player1_health_percent = float($Player1.health) / $Player1.MAX_HEALTH
    var player2_health_percent = float($Player2.health) / $Player2.MAX_HEALTH
    
    var winner = ""
    if player1_health_percent > player2_health_percent:
        winner = "Player 1"
    elif player2_health_percent > player1_health_percent:
        winner = "Player 2"
    else:
        winner = "Draw!"
    
    # Display result
    timer_label.text = "Time Up! " + winner + " wins!"
You can adjust the match_duration to set different match lengths. A 2-3 minute timer works well for most fighting games.

Depending on your game's design philosophy, you could either:

Have the timer be a core mechanic (like most traditional fighters)
Make it optional, allowing players to choose between timed and stock matches
Omit it entirely if you want more relaxed, open-ended battles
What kind of game feel are you going for with your platform fighter?

I think I will implement a timer now, but make it optional later

Edit
Adding a timer as a core feature with plans to make it optional later is a smart approach. This gives you the core functionality now while keeping your design flexible.

Here's a simple way to implement the timer:

gdscript

Copy
# Add to your Main scene script (the parent of both players)

# Timer settings
@export var match_duration = 180  # 3 minutes in seconds
@export var timer_enabled = true  # Can be made configurable later
var time_remaining = 0
var timer_label = null
var match_timer = null

func _ready():
    # Initialize and start the match timer if enabled
    if timer_enabled:
        time_remaining = match_duration
        create_timer_ui()
        start_match_timer()

func create_timer_ui():
    # Create CanvasLayer for UI
    var ui_layer = CanvasLayer.new()
    add_child(ui_layer)
    
    # Create timer label
    timer_label = Label.new()
    timer_label.horizontal_alignment = HORIZONTAL_ALIGNMENT_CENTER
    timer_label.vertical_alignment = VERTICAL_ALIGNMENT_CENTER
    timer_label.position = Vector2(512, 30)  # Center top of screen
    timer_label.size = Vector2(100, 40)
    timer_label.add_theme_font_size_override("font_size", 24)
    ui_layer.add_child(timer_label)
    
    # Initial update
    update_timer_display()

func start_match_timer():
    match_timer = Timer.new()
    match_timer.wait_time = 1.0
    match_timer.autostart = true
    match_timer.timeout.connect(_on_timer_tick)
    add_child(match_timer)

func _on_timer_tick():
    if time_remaining > 0:
        time_remaining -= 1
        update_timer_display()
    else:
        time_up()

func update_timer_display():
    var minutes = time_remaining / 60
    var seconds = time_remaining % 60
    timer_label.text = "%d:%02d" % [minutes, seconds]

func time_up():
    # Stop the timer
    match_timer.stop()
    
    # Determine winner based on remaining health
    var player1_health_percent = float($Player1.health) / $Player1.MAX_HEALTH
    var player2_health_percent = float($Player2.health) / $Player2.MAX_HEALTH
    
    var winner = ""
    if player1_health_percent > player2_health_percent:
        winner = "Player 1"
    elif player2_health_percent > player1_health_percent:
        winner = "Player 2"
    else:
        winner = "Draw!"
    
    # Display result
    timer_label.text = "Time Up! " + winner + " wins!"
    
    # You could also freeze the game or trigger a restart sequence here
    await get_tree().create_timer(3.0).timeout
    # restart_match() or show_game_over_screen()
Later, when you want to make it optional:

Add a setting in your game options
Update the timer_enabled variable based on that setting
Consider adding different match types (time, stock, stamina, etc.)
The current implementation determines the winner based on remaining health percentage, which is a good default. You could also consider other victory conditions like:

Most knockouts
Least damage taken
Most damage dealt
Collecting the most coins/items

how would I start going about coding an AI to play with?

Edit
Creating an AI opponent is a great next step for your game! Here's how you could approach building a simple AI for your platform fighter:

1. Basic AI Framework
Start by creating a new script that extends your existing player script:

gdscript

Copy
# AI_Player.gd - extend your existing Player script
extends "res://scripts/Player.gd"  # Adjust path to your player script

# AI difficulty settings
@export var difficulty = 1  # 1 = Easy, 2 = Medium, 3 = Hard

# AI state variables
var target_player = null
var decision_timer = 0
var decision_interval = 0.5  # How often the AI makes decisions
var current_action = "idle"  # idle, chase, attack, retreat, jump

func _ready():
    # Call the parent _ready function
    super._ready()
    
    # Find the player to target
    target_player = get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("players")[0]  # Assumes human player is in "players" group

func _physics_process(delta):
    # Update decision timer
    decision_timer += delta
    
    # Make new decisions periodically
    if decision_timer >= decision_interval:
        make_decision()
        decision_timer = 0
    
    # Execute current action
    execute_action(delta)
    
    # Let the parent script handle the actual movement & physics
    super._physics_process(delta)

func make_decision():
    # Distance to target
    var distance = global_position.distance_to(target_player.global_position)
    
    # Simple state machine to decide actions
    if distance > 200:
        current_action = "chase"
    elif distance < 60:
        # Randomly decide whether to attack or retreat
        if randf() < 0.7:
            current_action = "attack"
        else:
            current_action = "retreat"
    elif is_on_floor() and randf() < 0.1:
        current_action = "jump"
    else:
        current_action = "chase"

func execute_action(delta):
    match current_action:
        "idle":
            # Do nothing
            pass
        "chase":
            chase_player()
        "attack":
            attack_player()
        "retreat":
            retreat_from_player()
        "jump":
            if is_on_floor():
                velocity.y = JUMP_VELOCITY
2. Implement Basic Actions
gdscript

Copy
func chase_player():
    # Move toward the player
    var direction = sign(target_player.global_position.x - global_position.x)
    # Simulate input
    if direction > 0:
        velocity.x = SPEED
    elif direction < 0:
        velocity.x = -SPEED

func attack_player():
    # Check if in attack range and can attack
    if can_attack and !is_attacking:
        # Ensure facing the right direction
        var direction = sign(target_player.global_position.x - global_position.x)
        if (direction > 0 and !$Sprite2D.flip_h) or (direction < 0 and $Sprite2D.flip_h):
            $Sprite2D.flip_h = (direction > 0)
        
        # Execute attack
        perform_attack()

func retreat_from_player():
    # Move away from player
    var direction = -sign(target_player.global_position.x - global_position.x)
    if direction > 0:
        velocity.x = SPEED
    elif direction < 0:
        velocity.x = -SPEED
    
    # Maybe dash away if in danger
    if randf() < 0.2 and dash_charges > 0 and !is_dashing:
        start_horizontal_dash(direction)
3. Add More Advanced Behaviors Based on Difficulty
gdscript

Copy
func make_decision():
    # Base decision on difficulty
    match difficulty:
        1:  # Easy - predictable, slower reactions
            make_easy_decision()
        2:  # Medium - better positioning, sometimes uses special moves
            make_medium_decision()
        3:  # Hard - advanced tactics, combos, edge guarding
            make_hard_decision()

func make_easy_decision():
    # Simple follow and attack behavior with long pauses
    var distance = global_position.distance_to(target_player.global_position)
    
    if randf() < 0.3:  # 30% chance to pause/do nothing
        current_action = "idle"
    elif distance > 150:
        current_action = "chase"
    elif distance < 60:
        current_action = "attack"
    elif is_on_floor() and randf() < 0.05:
        current_action = "jump"

# Add medium and hard decision functions with more complex behaviors
4. To Use the AI:
Create a new scene that instances your AI_Player.gd script
Or replace the script on your second player with the AI script
Add the human player to a "players" group so the AI can find them
5. More Advanced Features to Add Later:
Pathfinding: Help the AI navigate complex platforms
Combo System: Chain attacks together
Defensive Moves: Dodging, blocking, or retreating when low on health
Item Usage: Pick up and use power-ups intelligently
Adaptive Learning: Adjust to the player's fighting style
This is a starting framework you can build on. The key is to start with simple behaviors and gradually add complexity as you test and refine the AI.

Would you like me to go into more detail on any specific aspect of the AI implementation?

Maybe before that, I create a welcome screen, that players can then press to start the game

Edit
Creating a welcome screen is a great idea before diving into AI development. It will give your game a more polished feel and create a proper game flow. Here's how to implement a simple welcome screen:

Creating a Welcome Screen
First, create a new scene:
Click on "Scene" in the top menu
Select "New Scene"
Choose "Control" as the root node (good for UI)
Rename it to "WelcomeScreen"
Set up the scene structure:

Copy
WelcomeScreen (Control)
├── ColorRect (Background)
├── Title (Label)
├── StartButton (Button)
└── OptionsButton (Button) [Optional]
Configure the nodes:
For the ColorRect:
Set Size to cover the whole screen (e.g., 1024x600)
Set Color to a dark color (e.g., #1e1e2e)
For the Title Label:
Set Text to your game's name
Set Theme Overrides > Font Size to something large (e.g., 48)
Position it near the top center
For the StartButton:
Set Text to "Start Game"
Set Theme Overrides > Font Size to something readable (e.g., 24)
Position it in the center of the screen
Add a script to the WelcomeScreen:
gdscript

Copy
extends Control

# Path to your main game scene
@export var game_scene_path = "res://scenes/main.tscn"

func _ready():
    # Connect the button's pressed signal
    $StartButton.pressed.connect(_on_start_button_pressed)
    
    # Optional: Add animations or visual effects
    # $Title.modulate.a = 0  # Start transparent
    # var tween = create_tween()
    # tween.tween_property($Title, "modulate:a", 1.0, 1.0)

func _on_start_button_pressed():
    # Change to the game scene
    get_tree().change_scene_to_file(game_scene_path)
Save the scene in your scenes folder (e.g., "res://scenes/welcome_screen.tscn")
Set it as the main scene:
Go to Project > Project Settings > Application > Run
Set "Main Scene" to your welcome_screen.tscn path
Making It More Interesting
You could enhance the welcome screen with:

Game logo or character art:
Add a TextureRect with your game's logo/art
Position it above the title
Background animation:
gdscript

Copy
# Add to _ready()
var tween = create_tween().set_loops()
tween.tween_property($Background, "modulate", Color(0.9, 0.9, 1.0), 2.0)
tween.tween_property($Background, "modulate", Color(1.0, 0.9, 0.9), 2.0)
Additional options:
Add buttons for "Options", "Credits", etc.
Connect them to show different screens or panels
Controller support:
gdscript

Copy
func _process(delta):
    # Start game when any button is pressed
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_accept") or Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_select"):
        _on_start_button_pressed()
This gives you a basic but functional welcome screen. Once you have this in place, you can then move on to implementing the AI opponent as we discussed earlier.

here it says: "@export var game_scene_path = "res://scenes/main.tscn""

What should this path be? should it be battle_arena tscn?

Edit
The path should point to the main scene of your game that actually contains the gameplay.

Based on your previous discussions, you probably have a scene structure where:

battle_arena.tscn contains the arena/level itself
You might have a main.tscn that includes the battle arena plus both players, UI elements, etc.
If you have a "main.tscn" that acts as the container for all gameplay elements, use that:

gdscript

Copy
@export var game_scene_path = "res://scenes/main.tscn"
If you don't have a separate main scene and your battle_arena.tscn already includes the players and everything needed to play the game, then use that instead:

gdscript

Copy
@export var game_scene_path = "res://scenes/battle_arena.tscn"
Choose whichever scene would properly start the actual gameplay when loaded. This should be the scene that contains both player characters, the arena, and any gameplay UI elements like health bars and the timer we discussed.

But the error says: W 0:00:00:0827   The parameter "delta" is never used in the function "_process()". If this is intended, prefix it with an underscore: "_delta".
  <GDScript Error>UNUSED_PARAMETER
  <GDScript Source>WelcomeScreen.gd:19

Edit
The error you're seeing is just a warning about an unused parameter. In GDScript, when you have a parameter you're not using in a function, it's a convention to prefix it with an underscore to indicate it's intentionally unused.

Let's fix that and also there seems to be an issue with the function name format in your code. The function name has asterisks instead of underscores:

gdscript

Copy
extends Control

# Path to your main game scene
@export var game_scene_path = "res://scenes/battle_arena.tscn"

func _ready():
    # Connect the button's pressed signal
    $StartButton.pressed.connect(_on_start_button_pressed)
    
    # Background animation
    var tween = create_tween().set_loops()
    tween.tween_property($Background, "modulate", Color(0.9, 0.9, 1.0), 2.0)
    tween.tween_property($Background, "modulate", Color(1.0, 0.9, 0.9), 2.0)
    
func _process(_delta):
    # Start game when any button is pressed
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_accept") or Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_select"):
        _on_start_button_pressed()
        
func _on_start_button_pressed():
    # Change to the game scene
    get_tree().change_scene_to_file(game_scene_path)
The two changes are:

Changed delta to _delta in the _process function signature
Fixed the function name *on*start_button_pressed() to be _on_start_button_pressed()
Also, make sure you have a node named "Background" that's a child of your WelcomeScreen, otherwise the tween animation will cause an error. If your background node has a different name, update that in the tween code.

This line is causing a crash:     $StartButton.pressed.connect(_on_start_button_pressed)

It says invalid get index 'presed' (on base: 'null instance')

Edit
The error is happening because the script can't find a node named "StartButton" as a child of the node this script is attached to. Let's fix this:

First, make sure you have a Button node named exactly "StartButton" (case-sensitive) as a direct child of your WelcomeScreen node.
If you've named it differently or it's not a direct child, you need to adjust your code to match your scene structure.
Here's how to fix it based on different scenarios:

Option 1: If you haven't created the button yet:

Right-click on your WelcomeScreen node
Select "Add Child Node"
Choose "Button"
Rename it to "StartButton"
Option 2: If your button has a different name:

Change $StartButton to match your button's actual name, for example: $PlayButton
Option 3: If your button is not a direct child:

Use a path to reach it, for example: $VBoxContainer/StartButton
Option 4: Find the button by another method:

gdscript

Copy
func _ready():
    # Get button by class instead of name
    var start_button = find_child("*Button*")
    if start_button:
        start_button.pressed.connect(_on_start_button_pressed)
    
    # Rest of your code...
Make sure to check your scene hierarchy to confirm the exact structure and naming of your nodes.

│   ├── ResultLabel (Label - "Game Over!")
│   ├── WinnerLabel (Label - "Player X Wins!")
│   ├── Spacer (Control with custom minimum size)

Configure each element:

Make ColorRect cover the whole screen with a semi-transparent dark color
Center the VBoxContainer
Style the labels and buttons as desired
3. Add a Script to the Game Over Screen
gdscript

Copy
extends Control

@export var welcome_screen_path = "res://scenes/welcome_screen.tscn"
@export var main_game_path = "res://scenes/battle_arena.tscn"

# Call this when showing the screen
func set_winner(winner_text):
    $VBoxContainer/WinnerLabel.text = winner_text

func _ready():
    $VBoxContainer/RestartButton.pressed.connect(_on_restart_pressed)
    $VBoxContainer/MainMenuButton.pressed.connect(_on_main_menu_pressed)

func _on_restart_pressed():
    get_tree().change_scene_to_file(main_game_path)

func _on_main_menu_pressed():
    get_tree().change_scene_to_file(welcome_screen_path)
4. Add Game Over Logic to Main Game
In your main game script (where the timer logic is), modify the time_up function:

gdscript

Copy
func time_up():
    # Stop the timer
    match_timer.stop()
    
    # Determine winner based on remaining health
    var player1_health_percent = float($Player1.health) / $Player1.MAX_HEALTH
    var player2_health_percent = float($Player2.health) / $Player2.MAX_HEALTH
    
    var winner_text = ""
    if player1_health_percent > player2_health_percent:
        winner_text = "Player 1 Wins!"
    elif player2_health_percent > player1_health_percent:
        winner_text = "Player 2 Wins!"
    else:
        winner_text = "It's a Draw!"
    
    # Show game over screen
    show_game_over(winner_text)

func show_game_over(winner_text):
    # Load the game over scene
    var game_over_scene = load("res://scenes/game_over_screen.tscn").instantiate()
    
    # Set the winner text
    game_over_scene.set_winner(winner_text)
    
    # Add it to the scene tree
    get_tree().root.add_child(game_over_scene)
    
    # Optional: remove the current scene
    # get_tree().current_scene.queue_free()
5. Also Trigger Game Over When a Player Is Defeated
You may also want to trigger the game over screen when a player is completely defeated. In your Player script, you could emit a signal:

gdscript

Copy
# In Player.gd, add at the top:
signal player_defeated(player_number)

# In the defeated() function, add:
func defeated():
    is_defeated = true
    print("Player defeated!")
    
    # Emit signal with player number
    emit_signal("player_defeated", 1)  # or 2 for player 2
    
    # Rest of your code...
Then connect to this signal in your main game script:

gdscript

Copy
func _ready():
    # Your existing code...
    
    # Connect player defeat signals
    $Player1.player_defeated.connect(_on_player_defeated.bind(1))
    $Player2.player_defeated.connect(_on_player_defeated.bind(2))

func _on_player_defeated(player_number):
    var winner_text = "Player " + str(3 - player_number) + " Wins!"
    show_game_over(winner_text)
This completes the game loop: Welcome Screen → Game → Game Over → (back to Welcome Screen or restart Game).

    var player1_health_percent = float($Player.health) / $Player.MAX_HEALTH

    var winner = ""

    # Add it to the scene tree
    get_tree().root.add_child(game_over_scene)

    # Optional: remove the current scene
    # get_tree().current_scene.queue_free()

Edit
There are a few issues in your battle arena script that need to be fixed:

The match_timer error occurs because you're trying to stop a timer that wasn't declared. You need to store a reference to your timer:
gdscript

Copy
# Change this:
var timer = Timer.new()

# To this:
match_timer = Timer.new()
You need to declare the match_timer variable at the top:
gdscript

Copy
# Timer settings
@export var match_duration = 20  # seconds
var time_remaining = 0
var timer_label = null
var match_timer = null  # Add this line
There's a function name error - replace asterisks with underscores:
gdscript

Copy
# Change this:
func *on*timer_tick():

# To this:
func _on_timer_tick():
In the time_up() function, you're using an undefined variable:
gdscript

Copy
# Change this:
show_game_over(winner_text)

# To this:
show_game_over(winner)
The reference to player nodes looks incorrect:
gdscript

Copy
# Change this:
var player1_health_percent = float($Player.health) / $Player.MAX_HEALTH

# To this (adjust to match your actual node path):
var player1_health_percent = float($Player1.health) / $Player1.MAX_HEALTH
Also, the label size seems unusually tall:

gdscript

Copy
timer_label.size = Vector2(100, 1130)  # This is very tall
Maybe you meant:

gdscript

Copy
timer_label.size = Vector2(100, 30)
Make these changes and the timer system should work correctly.

Edit
The error is happening because your signal is sending 2 arguments but the receiving method _on_player_defeated in battle_arena.gd is only expecting 1 argument.

Let's fix this by updating your player scripts and the battle arena script:

First, in your Player.gd and Player2.gd scripts, check how the signal is defined and emitted:
gdscript

Copy
# In both player scripts (Player.gd and Player2.gd):

# At the top, make sure the signal is defined with one parameter:
signal player_defeated(player_number)

# In the defeated() function:
func defeated():
    is_defeated = true
    print("Player defeated!")
    
    # Emit signal with just the player number (1 or 2)
    emit_signal("player_defeated", 1)  # or 2 for player 2
    
    # Rest of your code...
Next, in your battle_arena.gd script, you need to add the _on_player_defeated function that's missing:
gdscript

Copy
# Add this to your battle_arena.gd:

func _ready():
    # Your existing code...
    
    # Connect player defeat signals
    $Player1.player_defeated.connect(_on_player_defeated)
    $Player2.player_defeated.connect(_on_player_defeated)

func _on_player_defeated(player_number):
    var winner_text = "Player " + str(3 - player_number) + " Wins!"
    show_game_over(winner_text)
The issue is that you're trying to connect to a method that doesn't exist or doesn't have the right signature. By adding the proper _on_player_defeated method to your battle arena script, you should resolve this error.

Also note there's another issue in your stack trace: *on*attack_hit() should be _on_attack_hit() - make sure you don't have asterisks in your function names.

Edit
I see two issues in your code that need to be fixed:

There are asterisks in your function names instead of underscores:
Change *on*timer_tick() to _on_timer_tick()
Change *on*player_defeated() to _on_player_defeated()
There seems to be a signal connection issue. The way you're connecting signals is causing problems:
gdscript

Copy
$Player1.player_defeated.connect(_on_player_defeated.bind(1))
$Player2.player_defeated.connect(_on_player_defeated.bind(2))
The problem is that if your player script is already emitting the player number, using .bind(1) will add an extra parameter, causing the error.

Here's the fixed code:

gdscript

The main changes I made:

Fixed the signal emission in defeated() - I moved the signal emission before disabling physics processing and made sure it only happens once
Added a print statement specifically saying "Player 2 defeated!" for clearer debugging
There was a redundant commented emit_signal line which I removed
Cleaned up the code formatting for better readability
Make sure you have a similar change in your Player1 script, where you emit player_defeated(1) in the Player 1's defeated() function.

Edit
The error message is quite specific about what's going wrong: when Player 2 emits the player_defeated signal, it's sending 2 arguments but the receiving method _on_player_defeated in battle_arena.gd is only expecting 1 argument.

Let's fix this by examining both sides of the signal connection:

In battle_arena.gd, check how the _on_player_defeated function is defined:
gdscript

Copy
func _on_player_defeated(player_number):
    var winner_text = "Player " + str(3 - player_number) + " Wins!"
    show_game_over(winner_text)
This function is expecting a single parameter (player_number).
In player2.gd, check how you're emitting the signal:
gdscript

Copy
# This is the current problematic line:
emit_signal("player_defeated", 2)
Either:

A. Godot is automatically adding an extra parameter when emitting the signal (sometimes this happens with certain connection methods), or
B. The signal is defined to expect more parameters than you're providing

The simplest fix is to change your _on_player_defeated function in battle_arena.gd to accept the extra parameter:

gdscript

Copy
func _on_player_defeated(player_number, extra_param=null):
    var winner_text = "Player " + str(3 - player_number) + " Wins!"
    show_game_over(winner_text)
This makes the second parameter optional, so it won't cause an error even if it's provided.

Another approach is to connect the signal differently in battle_arena.gd:

gdscript

Copy
# In _ready():
$Player1.player_defeated.connect(func(player_number): _on_player_defeated(player_number))
$Player2.player_defeated.connect(func(player_number): _on_player_defeated(player_number))
This uses an anonymous function to explicitly extract just the parameter you need.

Script inherits from native type 'Control', so it can't be assigned to an object of type: 'Node2D'

Edit
This error indicates that you're trying to load a scene or script that inherits from Control and add it to a Node2D parent, which isn't allowed in Godot's scene hierarchy.

Here's what's happening:

Your GameOverScreen likely inherits from Control (for UI)
Your battle arena script is trying to add it to a Node2D
To fix this, you have two options:

Option 1: Use a CanvasLayer (Recommended)
The best way to show UI elements over your game scene is to use a CanvasLayer:

gdscript

Copy
func show_game_over(winner_text):
    # Create a CanvasLayer to hold the UI
    var canvas_layer = CanvasLayer.new()
    get_tree().root.add_child(canvas_layer)
    
    # Load the game over scene
    var game_over_scene = load("res://scenes/game_over_screen.tscn").instantiate()
    
    # Set the winner text
    game_over_scene.set_winner(winner_text)
    
    # Add it to the CanvasLayer
    canvas_layer.add_child(game_over_scene)
Option 2: Change your GameOverScreen to inherit from Node2D
If you prefer, you could modify your GameOverScreen to inherit from Node2D instead of Control, but this is less ideal for UI elements.

Option 3: Use get_tree().change_scene_to
Another approach is to completely change the scene instead of adding the game over screen as a child:

gdscript

Copy
func show_game_over(winner_text):
    # Store the winner text in a global script or singleton
    # For example, if you have a GameManager singleton:
    GameManager.winner_text = winner_text
    
    # Change to the game over scene
    get_tree().change_scene_to_file("res://scenes/game_over_screen.tscn")
Then in your GameOverScreen's _ready() function, you would get the winner text from the global script.

Option 1 is generally the best approach for overlaying UI on top of your game scene.

What if at some point I'd like the game over text to be sprites? which way should I program it then?

Edit
If you'd like to use sprites for your game over screen instead of UI elements, you have flexibility in how you implement it. Here are your options:

Option 1: CanvasLayer with Sprites
You can still use a CanvasLayer approach, but instead of UI controls, you'd use Sprite2D nodes:

gdscript

Copy
func show_game_over(winner_text):
    # Create a CanvasLayer to hold the sprites
    var canvas_layer = CanvasLayer.new()
    get_tree().root.add_child(canvas_layer)
    
    # Load the game over scene (which would contain sprites)
    var game_over_scene = load("res://scenes/game_over_screen.tscn").instantiate()
    
    # Set the winner text (now might be changing which sprite is visible)
    game_over_scene.set_winner(winner_text)
    
    # Add it to the CanvasLayer
    canvas_layer.add_child(game_over_scene)
In this approach, your GameOverScreen scene would still inherit from Node2D or CanvasLayer, but contain Sprite2D nodes instead of UI controls.

Option 2: Node2D Approach
You could create a Node2D-based game over screen that uses sprites:

gdscript

Copy
func show_game_over(winner_text):
    # Load the game over scene
    var game_over_scene = load("res://scenes/game_over_screen.tscn").instantiate()
    game_over_scene.set_winner(winner_text)
    
    # Position it in front of everything else
    game_over_scene.z_index = 100
    
    # Add it to the scene
    add_child(game_over_scene)
Your GameOverScreen would inherit from Node2D and contain Sprite2D nodes for the visuals.

Option 3: Scene Transition
You could completely change scenes:

gdscript

Copy
func show_game_over(winner_text):
    # Store winner info in a global script
    GameManager.winner_text = winner_text
    
    # Change to a sprite-based game over scene
    get_tree().change_scene_to_file("res://scenes/game_over_screen.tscn")
My Recommendation
I'd recommend the CanvasLayer approach (Option 1) even for sprites because:

CanvasLayer is designed to show content above the game world
It ensures your game over elements are always visible regardless of camera position
It keeps a clean separation between your game logic and visual elements
You can easily transition between UI and sprite-based elements as your design evolves
This gives you the most flexibility for future changes while maintaining good structure.

Ok, I'm getting a little lost. I set up a scene of a GameOverScreen node2d. I want to use the canvas layer approach, should I change the text in my battle_arena script to option 1? Is that going to be poiting at some things that don't exist yet?

Edit
I understand it can get a bit confusing. Let me simplify this step by step:

Since you already created a GameOverScreen as a Node2D, you'll need to modify the show_game_over function in your battle_arena script to use the CanvasLayer approach:
gdscript

Copy
func show_game_over(winner_text):
    # Create a CanvasLayer to hold the game over screen
    var canvas_layer = CanvasLayer.new()
    add_child(canvas_layer)
    
    # Load the game over scene
    var game_over_scene = load("res://scenes/game_over_screen.tscn").instantiate()
    
    # Add it to the CanvasLayer
    canvas_layer.add_child(game_over_scene)
    
    # Now call the set_winner method if it exists
    if game_over_scene.has_method("set_winner"):
        game_over_scene.set_winner(winner_text)
Make sure your GameOverScreen scene has a script attached with a set_winner method:
gdscript

Copy
# GameOverScreen.gd
extends Node2D

func set_winner(winner_text):
    # Find the label in your scene and set its text
    $WinnerLabel.text = winner_text
    
    # If you don't have a label yet, you'll need to add one
    # Or if you're using sprites, you'd show the appropriate sprite here
If you haven't already, add a Label node to your GameOverScreen scene named "WinnerLabel" where the winner text will be displayed.
This approach should work with your existing Node2D-based GameOverScreen scene. The CanvasLayer just makes sure it displays on top of everything else.

Is there a specific part that's still unclear?

This is my current game over screen text in script:

extends Control
@export var welcome_screen_path = "res://scenes/welcome_screen.tscn"
@export var main_game_path = "res://scenes/battle_arena.tscn"
# Call this when showing the screen
func set_winner(winner_text):
    $VBoxContainer/WinnerLabel.text = winner_text
func _ready():
    $VBoxContainer/RestartButton.pressed.connect(_on_restart_pressed)
    $VBoxContainer/MainMenuButton.pressed.connect(_on_main_menu_pressed)
func onrestart_pressed():
    get_tree().change_scene_to_file(main_game_path)
func onmain_menu_pressed():
    get_tree().change_scene_to_file(welcome_screen_path)

Edit
I see the script for your GameOverScreen. There are a few changes needed:

First, fix the function names with asterisks to use underscores:
gdscript

Copy
func _on_restart_pressed():  # Changed from *on*restart_pressed
    get_tree().change_scene_to_file(main_game_path)

func _on_main_menu_pressed():  # Changed from *on*main_menu_pressed
    get_tree().change_scene_to_file(welcome_screen_path)
Since your GameOverScreen is a Control node (UI), we need to update your battle_arena.gd script to handle this correctly. Here's how the show_game_over function should look:
gdscript

Copy
func show_game_over(winner_text):
    # Create a CanvasLayer to hold the UI
    var canvas_layer = CanvasLayer.new()
    add_child(canvas_layer)
    
    # Load the game over scene
    var game_over_scene = load("res://scenes/game_over_screen.tscn").instantiate()
    
    # Set the winner text
    game_over_scene.set_winner(winner_text)
    
    # Add it to the CanvasLayer
    canvas_layer.add_child(game_over_scene)
This approach will work with your existing Control-based GameOverScreen. The CanvasLayer allows adding UI elements (Control nodes) on top of your game world (Node2D nodes).

Make sure your GameOverScreen scene has:

A Control node as the root
A VBoxContainer as a child
A Label named "WinnerLabel" inside the VBoxContainer
Buttons named "RestartButton" and "MainMenuButton" inside the VBoxContainer
These names need to match exactly what your script is looking for, or you'll get "Node not found" errors.
